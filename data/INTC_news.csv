Intel is attempting to cloud the transaction with a lawsuit against an ex-employee who """"secretly"""" accepted a job at Micron. Flash and DRAM are now meaningless for Micron investors."
4231781,2019-01-07,Intel Aims For AI Throne With New Architecture,Intel is working on a new architecture that will transform the mainstream computing landscape. The new architecture will initially not be a replacement but an addition to the existing architectures. Multiple long-term undertakings make Intel an excellent long-term investment.

4232403,2019-01-09,Intel: Time For Major Decision,"Six months later, still no CEO announcement. Growth expected to slow considerably in 2019. Where's the company going next?"
4232321,2019-01-09,Intel Hiring Practices Offers A Glimpse At Stock Price Direction,"Intel’s stock price can be correlated to its job openings. The stock price increases or decreases in sync with hiring activity. Intel has outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average after an increase in hiring activity. Intel has underperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average after a decrease in hiring activity. During the fourth quarter of 2018, hiring activity increased and would portend an improved stock performance in the first quarter of 2019."

4234862,2019-01-22,Intel's Earnings Report: What To Expect?,"The expectations for Intel are EPS of $ 1.22 on revenue of $19.01 billion. Those numbers represent year-over-year growth of 13% for EPS and 11.5% for revenues. On the other hand, other analysts are bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in decreasing earnings EPS of 1.11%."
4234849,2019-01-22,What Can Investors Anticipate From Intel's Results?,"Intel will announce Q4 2018 and FY 2018 results on Thursday. Results will generally be in line, but we expect a more negative outlook due to an industry-wide slowdown. China's growth, smartphone sales, trade war, etc., are all contributing downside factors. However, Intel's dominant market position should imply less impact relative to its peers. Intel remains attractive relative to its peers, but an industry-wide slowdown poses significant uncertainty."
4234720,2019-01-22,Intel's Stock May Jump After Results,"Intel is seeing bullish options betting heading into results. The technical chart suggests a breakout is near. The stock's valuation is among the cheapest in the group, despite strong margins."
4235490,2019-01-24,Intel Swings And Misses,Q4 results were rather mixed. No new CEO announced. 2019 guidance well short of expectations. Dividend raise seems a bit light.
4235866,2019-01-27,"Intel: Not Necessarily Appealing, Amidst No More Growth","Intel has seen a real growth slowdown driven by market forces, but perhaps poor execution as well. Earnings multiples remain very compelling, but cash flow conversion is another issue. I believe that Intel is lagging in terms of development which makes me cautious given the cash flow multiples, as this remains a strong point in the cycle."
4236022,2019-01-28,Is 2019 Uncertainty Good For Intel Investors?,Intel stock fell after weaker than expected fourth quarter revenue. The outlook for 2019 reflects the weak fourth quarter with full year revenue up 1% and Non-GAAP EPS up 0.5%. Intel has excellent prospects for growth in 2020 and beyond and a P/E of 10. It is a strong buy.
4236016,2019-01-28,Intel: Buy Or Sell?,Intel sank 6 percent on extreme volume. Friday's drop was due to unfavorable guidance revision. Was the drop overdone?
4236316,2019-01-29,Intel: Is The Market Too Pessimistic?,
4236312,2019-01-29,Intel: Buy For Solid Financials Despite A Bumpy Year Ahead,"Intel reported Q4 financial results, beating on EPS but missing on revenue. The stock plummeted 5% the next trading day on cautious guidance. Although the revenue miss is a negative event for INTC, the actual numbers are not as bad as they appear. Revenue increased 9.4%, while EPS grew 18% in the quarter. Intel's performance demonstrates strong financial efficiency standards during difficult times, which is the primary reason to own the stock at the moment. Although the competition continues to be stiff, Intel stock provides a solid margin of safety, with almost 3% dividend yield, 10 forward P/E, and impressive revenue and EPS growth."
4237083,2019-01-31,Intel: Any Epyc Impact?,"Ryzen and Epyc chips have been out for some time, and even newer versions have been released. AMD is doing nicely, but not crushing Intel. Intel put in another good quarter in a great year. At the current market price, based on the latest dividend increase, dividend growth investors might want to wait for a price drop."
4237017,2019-01-31,Should Intel Buy Mellanox?,"Some media reported Intel offered to buy Mellanox for $6 billion. The deal partly makes sense from an operational perspective but there are regulatory risks. The offer represents a premium to the historical valuation of Mellanox. But considering the growth potential, the offer is not so generous."
4237747,2019-02-03,Is Intel A Long Term Buy?,"Intel saw its shares sells off after disappointing guidance. For investors focused on the long term, Intel may offer value. The company should be a continued beneficiary of the growing number of devices powered by its chips."
4239881,2019-02-11,Intel - Buy An R&D Powerhouse,Intel is trading at an attractive discount thanks to the market’s overreaction to near term headwinds which ignores a multitude of longer term positive catalysts. Intel is also a rare income play in the technology sector which now offers a 2.46% dividend yield which beats the S&P’s 2% yield. The company has proven its ability to enter emerging markets offering the highest growth rates and largest addressable markets in the technology space.
4241125,2019-02-14,Intel: From PCs To Data,"We see Intel's multi-year turnaround story making great progress. We see strong revenue growth. We see the strategic allocation of capital to R&D, manufacturing, and acquisitions."
4242878,2019-02-21,Here's Why Intel's Bull Run Isn't Over,Intel options have seen some bullish bets placed in recent days. The technical chart signals a breakout is on the horizon. The stock hasn't gotten cheaper vs. its peers.
4244225,2019-02-26,Intel's Intrinsic Price Is Between $25 To $36 Using Free Cash Flow Analysis,"Intel's 2018 revenue is about $71 billion and is forecasted to grow to $104.5 billion in 2028 with a CAGR of 3.9%. Intel's revenue structure mainly consists of Client Computing Group ($37B, 52%), Data Center Group ($23B, 32%), IoT Group ($3.5B, 5%), Non-volatile Memory Solution Group ($4.3B, 6%) and Programmable Solutions. Due to slow growth/decline in the PC market, I expect Intel's major revenue growth would come from Data Center Group, IoT Group, and Non-volatile Memory solutions group; however, growth rates."
4245241,2019-02-28,Buy Intel On The Coming Pullback,
4245165,2019-02-28,Intel Long-Term Target Prices,"Intel’s 4Q earnings announcement (ER) is just like any other tech firm’s 4Q - a missed 4Q ER, a downside 1Q guidance, but a better 2H 2019. What's new is that Intel’s new hire of its first non-engineering CEO Robert Swan signals an important company’s strategic shift to financial focus. As a result, Street analysts have been very optimistic about Intel’s future margin, capex, and free cash flow. Intel has transitioned into a data-centric company from a PC company to combat AMD’s low-price assault on data center market share, including """"buying companies to bulk up on IP or eliminate the competition."""" Using analysts’ long-term forecasts, Intel’s longer-term stock price path can be sketched out to hit around $60 one year out or 20% by 2021."
4245672,2019-03-01,Intel Has A Marvelous Tailwind From Foveros,"The new products unveiled at MWC 2019 Barcelona event justified why I remained long INTC. Intel’s Foveros 3D Stacking technology-enabled 10-nanometer Lakefield System-on-Chip has fabulous long-term commercial potential. The proprietary Foveros chip design IP is a marvelous tailwind for Intel's $60 billion/year desktop & server semiconductor business. The hybrid x86 3D stacking semiconductor design will persuade Apple to keep using Intel processors for its Mac computer products. 3D stacked processors has future applications in smart devices, robotics, and self-driving cars."
4246954,2019-03-07,A Look At Intel's Prospects In 2019,Intel finally appointed a new CEO. The options for the stock are bullish. The fundamental suggest the stock is cheap.
4247790,2019-03-11,Intel Vs. AMD: Battle For Market Share,"2018 was a great year for both Intel and AMD, particularly in the CPU market. AMD's top-line increased 23% as they gained market share from Intel, while Intel themselves managed a 13% revenue increase by inflating their CPU prices on the market. My forecast of the CPU market share between these two rivals for the next 4 years indicates their monopoly of the market may be ending. I identified a significant threat to the traditional x86 CPU market in the rise of ARM-based processors which are rapidly creeping into the market."
4250546,2019-03-22,Should Intel Worry About AMD?,"Revenue growth and market share are two important metrics to affect Intel and AMD stock prices in a different fashion. For a smaller AMD, its stock price is more responsive to market share changes. Yet, the larger Intel is more sensitive to total revenue growth. AMD shares have gained over 100% in 2018 mainly due to market share gain over Intel, while Intel shares gained from its total revenue growth, despite market share loss. Intel can afford to lose 10% market share to AMD for every 1% increase in its total revenue growth without affecting Intel stock price. While AMD looks to increase its market share in the next two years, Intel stock price is not threatened as long as its revenue has any positive growth outlook."
4252154,2019-04-01,Determining Market Capitalization With Extreme Consistency And Accuracy,"Short Levi Strauss. Its longer-term valuation is between $9.82 and $10.11. Buy and hold Intel. It has the potential to reach a revenue $118B from the current $77B. Sell Qualcomm as it is the most leveraged by far in its sector. This is a powerful tool for IPO, M&A, Angel, VC managers and investors to value share price before and after IPOs."
4253082,2019-04-05,Micron And Intel: Fishy?,
4253172,2019-04-07,In Case Intel's Share Price Collapses,"Although Intel has outpaced the market since December's low, Wells Fargo downgraded Intel to """"market perform"""" on Friday, citing valuation concerns and competition from AMD. My site is still moderately bullish on Intel, but I present two ways of hedging it for longs who want to add downside protection here. I note that the second hedge has an upside cap which is higher than Wells Fargo's new price target for Intel."
4253415,2019-04-08,Intel Helps Drive Data Center Advancements,"It's clear Intel is now thinking about more comprehensive sets of solutions for data centers, CSPs, and other institutions with high-performance computing demands. It's a bit surprising it took the company as long as it did to start telling these more all-encompassing stories, but there's little doubt it will be a key focus over the next several years. CPUs will continue to be important, but the reinvention of computing, memory, and storage architectures will yield some of the most interesting developments to come."
4253808,2019-04-10,Intel: Still Leading The Way,
4254550,2019-04-15,Process Technology Is Key If History Is About To Repeat Itself With Intel Vs. AMD,
4255394,2019-04-18,Intel: Positive Financials By Withdrawing From The 5G Smartphone Market,"Intel's April 16, 2019, announcement that it would exit the 5G smartphone modem market was favorably received by the market. Because Intel management saw no clear path to profitability and positive returns with $40 5G smartphone modems, the company has instead emphasized production of $700 server CPUs. This strategy is an about-face to the company's decision in 2008 to emphasize $29 Atom chips for netbooks instead of $279 desktop Penryn CPUs. Yet, the withdrawal of one of the core next-generation technologies seems counterintuitive in the face of Intel's sluggish PC-centric segment. This article highlights the positive financial impact of the company's decision."
4255203,2019-04-18,Intel Fails Again,"Intel fails in their attempt to capture a 5G modem business. The financial hit is expected to be minimal, but the company appears rudderless with plans for other 5G devices. The tepid buyback plan was a signal of future business struggles. The stock is expensive with limited EPS growth by 2020."
4255496,2019-04-19,Intel Earnings Preview: The Sentiment Is Less Bullish Than It Was In January,Intel will report first quarter earnings after the closing bell on Thursday. Analysts expect the earnings to be flat compared to the first quarter of 2018. Analysts have shifted to a less bullish posture in recent months and the short interest ratio is the highest it has been since September.
4255701,2019-04-22,Intel May Rise To A 20-Year High Following Results - Here's Why,"Intel may rise in the weeks following its quarterly results, to its highest price in 20 years. Options betting is very bullish. We first started noting bullish activity in Intel back in November."
4256905,2019-04-25,Intel Drops On Bad Guidance,Q1 results were okay but not great. Q2 and full-year guidance well below estimates. Caution is not a welcome sign for investors.
4257738,2019-04-29,Intel Earnings Are Not What They Seem To Be,"Intel beat Q1, but gave a soft Q2 guidance and took down FY guidance. That seems a bit odd, doesn't it? We explain the incongruence. Intel's data center weakness is real, but what the company is not telling investors is the impact AMD's products are having on its market share. Due to competitive dynamics, we predict ongoing Intel under-performance."

4262195,2019-05-09,Intel: Keep Lowering The Bar,The stock drops below $50 after management presentation. Analyst estimates continue to move lower. Do rising yield and the buyback provide reason for optimism?
4262491,2019-05-10,Intel Investor Day Presents An Overly Optimistic Future,"Intel's investor day, as downbeat as it was, provides a far too optimistic view of the future. Single digit growth guidance suggests large market share losses to AMD. Even if Intel delivers on the roadmap presented, it will stay behind the AMD/TSMC technology roadmap until 2021 or 2022."
4263327,2019-05-12,Intel: An Epyc Opportunity?,"AMD and Intel have both recently reported Q1 2019 results. Both AMD and Intel did not perform as well in this quarter as they did a year ago. The AMD Zen architecture chips are putting some pressure on Intel to accelerate in 10nm spending. At just over $45, INTC is priced above my $43 buy price."
4263471,2019-05-13,Resolved: Swan:Intel = Nadella: Microsoft,
4264054,2019-05-14,Intel: Failures Mount,Intel disappointed investors with long-term financial projections. The chip giant remains on a path of losing technology leadership. The financial projections actually appear aggressive following the abandonment of the 5G modem business. Watch share buybacks for any indications that the board of directors has confidence in the future.
4263896,2019-05-14,Intel: Crash Protection Kicks In,"Last month, I presented two ways Intel shareholders could limit their risk in the event Intel shares declined. Since then, Intel shares have dropped more than 19%. Here, I show how the Intel hedges from last month have ameliorated that decline and briefly discuss courses of action for hedged Intel longs now."
4264263,2019-05-15,Intel: Growth At The Cost Of Margins,"Intel’s investor day presentations left us with mixed messages regarding the company’s outlook. Focus on TAM expansion at the expense of its margin profile is a concern. Growth targets require heavy investments to materialize. Even at ~10x PE, we're not dipping into the Intel story just yet."
4264884,2019-05-17,How AMD And Others Are Weakening Intel's Hold On X86,"For quite some time, Intel’s data-centric business used to outperform its PC-centric counterpart by growing much faster. Intel’s earnings release in Q1 reveals that the data-centric business was a weakness instead of the strength that it has been in the past. Intel’s cites China as part of the reason for this change and certain developments in China could ensure that more weakness is in store for Intel. If more weakness is to be expected in future earnings releases, then the stock is unlikely to do well as long as these issues have not been addressed."
4264749,2019-05-17,'Intel' Suggests Semiconductors Ready To Byte The Bullet (Video),INTC represents over 11% of the SOXX. Semis represent over 11% of NASDAQ 100. Charts suggest a large degree correction is just starting.
4265427,2019-05-20,Intel: Really Attractive After Recent 25% Sell-Off,"Intel shares are down 25% from their 52-week high. A combination of disappointing earnings and China fears has put pressure on the stock. However, the company's tremendous performance during 2016, 2017, and 2018, combined with this weakness, has resulted in a low 10x P/E ratio. Intel pays a safe 2.8% yield as well, making it attractive to me as a dividend growth investor looking for technology exposure."
4267025,2019-05-29,Intel's Stock May See A Sharp Bounce,Intel's stock saw some bullish options bets yesterday. The technical chart shows that the stock is severely oversold. The valuation for the stock is its lowest in years.
4269237,2019-06-08,Intel Is Worth More Than 10x Forward PE,"Compared with AMD and Nvidia, Intel's recent share price has been beaten down disproportionately by the same macro picture and industry-specific factors. Apparently, the market has priced in Intel’s inability to launch its 10nm chips in time to defend its CPU market share from AMD’s EPYC and 7nm products. Despite of all the negatives, using a revenue perspective, Intel’s fair value should be between $57 and $62. Intel is still undervalued by 25%-35%. Using an earnings perspective, Intel’s fair value should be between $46 and $50. Intel is undervalued by 5%-10%. The fact that the current market has priced Intel’s stock more towards its profitability than revenue points out an alarming possibility that Intel may lose more significant market share to AMD."
4269999,2019-06-13,3 Great Tech Blue Chip Buys,"Tech stocks are a great source of strong returns over time as they tend to ride strong secular economic trends that can persist for decades. Dividend paying blue-chips Intel, Skyworks Solutions, and Expedia have all been beaten down in recent weeks and months over market fears related to disruption risk and the US/China trade war. This is a good time for contrarian dividend investors to buy these three quality companies at 12% to 34% discounts to fair value. Over the next five to 10 years, I expect INTC, SWKS, and EXPE to deliver strong double-digit total returns as well as safe and steadily rising dividends. Just remember that all investing is probabilistic, so never forget to use good risk management and proper asset allocation in your portfolio."
4272200,2019-06-26,"Intel, Huawei Consequences And The 5G Effect: Headwinds And Tailwinds","The age of 5G is upon us and Intel should benefit as a major holder of 5G patents and as a supplier of crucial components. The decision by the U.S. government to ban Huawei from sourcing U.S. components is a wildcard that could throw things off. Intel should get a boost from 5G, but it’s possible that 5G could also create long-term headwinds for the company. The upcoming G-20 meeting could bring relief for Intel, but it could also make things worse for the company depending on how the talks go."
4272660,2019-06-28,Intel: An Iconic Company At Inflection Point,"Intel exceeded expectations in Q1, but lowered its outlook, which resulted in an approximate 25% price drop from its peak in April 2019. Competitors are taking Intel's market share. A P/E valuation of around 10 and a 2.7% dividend yield seem to be attractive, but the stock price can go lower."
4273225,2019-07-02,Intel Briefing: Chips Are Showing Weakness (Video),"Semis lagging the market, failing to make new highs over April. Intel has enough of a corrective bounce to be complete. A measured move would take INTC under 40. NVIDIA has the clearest setup for a downturn."

4275473,2019-07-17,Big News From Europe For Intel And Qualcomm,"The future of automotive is determined not only by robotics and artificial intelligence but also by connecting cars with their surrounding. With 5G, there will be a completely new market with an impressively high market volume. Hardly noticed by investors, something trend-setting has happened in Europe, which will appeal especially to Qualcomm and Intel investors. The chances are increasing that the respective chipsets can be used quickly in Europe. Intel and Qualcomm can be the first companies to build up market shares in Europe - a huge advantage. Even given the current challenges, both companies are relatively favourably valued."
4276706,2019-07-23,Intel's Outlook May Help Boost Shares,"Intel reports results on July 25. Analysts are looking for a weak quarter. However, there are signs of improvement in the sector."
4279018,2019-07-30,Intel: Under The Surface Failure,Intel beat Q2 results due in part to sales pull-in from the trade war and some short-term PC market dynamics. The company still saw operating income plunge $460 million. The future business areas of data center and mobile modems are both either struggling or already failed. The 2021 financial targets remain at risk despite a target of gross margins dipping to 57% from above 60% now.
4287831,2019-08-26,Intel: Zen And The Art Of Chip Production,"AMD and Intel have both recently reported Q2 2019 results. Both AMD and Intel did not perform as well in this quarter as they did a year ago. The AMD Zen architecture chips are putting some pressure on Intel, but with Intel set to release 10nm later this year, that may be at an end. At just over $45, INTC is priced very close to my $44 buy price."
4288864,2019-08-30,"Surveilling The Laggards Part II - Intel's Achilles' Heel Hasn't Changed, But The Stock Is Undervalued In Low-To-Mid $40s","The fact is Intel's a high-tech manufacturer, and funding that """"capex"""" for 30 years takes work. Capex as a percentage of Intel's cash flow has slowly risen the last 10 years. While Moore's Law and the fab manufacturing provides a formidable barrier to entry, Morningstar has the moat under pressure. AMD is expected to grab market share over the next few years. In low $40s, Intel is trading at a significant discount to perceived intrinsic value."
4290644,2019-09-09,Intel: Value Investment For Future Data Growth,"According to the price-to-earnings and EV/EBITDA ratios, Intel is valued around 50% below the industry averages.

         Its performance during the last quarter of 2018 suggests it could perform a lot better than the overall market during a recession.

4291929,2019-09-16,Intel: Don't Chase This Yield,"Intel has rallied back to the low $50s, where the dividend yield loses appeal. The company is struggling with market share losses to AMD and a CPU processor business that has already pulled forward sales. The stock trades at 12x forward EPS estimates with no growth forecasted. The dividend yield loses all appeal below the current 2.4% rate."
4292079,2019-09-17,Intel Vs. AMD: Losing The Battle But Winning The War,"Due to its sheer size, Intel stock price is historically more sensitive to revenue growth than to market share. Intel has a good chance to win the CPU war if 3Q revenue is ready to ramp from a renewed corporate IT budget and the scheduled 10nm launch. In contrast, due to its small market share, AMD’s stock price is more sensitive to market share changes than to revenue growth. AMD’s relative valuation will increase as it will win the battle of market share increase against Intel from its 7nm new product offerings. Relative to AMD, Intel is considerably undervalued, given the expected market share and revenue growth."
4293810,2019-09-26,Intel Stock Growth Depends On The 10 And 7 Nanometer Chips,"Intel is introducing 10 nanometer chips and two years later, 7 nanometer chips, which is a major change to its key product lines. 10/7 nanometer chips cost $6.9 billion in the first half of 2019 alone, equal to 20% of revenue, while no new chips were shipped. These chips should make Intel’s proprietary products sell in larger quantities at excellent margins. Intel is a strong buy."
4293912,2019-09-27,Computing Power: Beyond The Size Of Processors,"The ever-increasing levels of data usage are likely to require increasing levels of processing capacity.

4295395,2019-10-07,Why We Remain Long Intel,"We went long INTC when it was trading below $25. We added some more when it traded below $45. Intel’s supremacy on x86 processors is why we still remain long INTC. We are not worried over the hype on AMD’s Ryzen and EPYC. In spite of AMD’s more affordable Ryzen processors, Intel remains the go-to processor supplier for most PC manufacturers. A healthy balance sheet and highly profitable data center business convinced us Intel can win a pricing war against Advanced Micro Devices."

At the moment, AMD is promoting the price/performance ratio of this Epyc generation. Given that, there is an extremely impressive defeat for Intel. Investors need to look at AMD's operations without bias and ask themselves whether management is really getting every possible USD of profit out of the company. In my opinion, AMD should put the focus a little more away from the penetration strategy, and instead, switch a little more to the skimming strategy."

4300545,2019-10-30,Intel's Q3: Raised Outlook Vs. Flat Earnings,"Intel’s Q3 earnings came in mostly flat, but a raised outlook more than made up for it. Results varied with some units doing better than others, which includes strength in the data-centric unit offsetting weakness in the PC-centric unit. Intel’s 10nm process seems to be a work in progress, which could become a problem since competitors are quickly moving forward. Intel needs to deliver on what it has promised, something that it has not always done in recent years."
4300374,2019-10-30,Intel Growth Returns,Revenue was $1.2 billion over guidance and full year guidance is up $1.5 billion to $71 billion. Intel stock price grew 4.2% on the day after the earnings announcement to $56 per share. The 10nm yield lowered gross margin by 5.6 percentage points but it and the 7nm are looking better than in earlier guidance. It is a strong buy.
4302377,2019-11-04,Intel Breaks Out,"The good news in Intel’s 3Q earnings results is the surprising yet exciting datacenter growth which is viewed as the beginning of a 4-6 quarters’ uptrend. Intel still benefits more from the total revenue increase, despite the continued loss of market share to AMD. There is some short-term optimism to temporarily ignore Intel’s struggle to advance from 14nm to 10nm, and to 7nm eventually. Intel’s 3Q win does not look like a game changer as the Street has not completely reflected the improved outlook in its long-term fundamental forecasts. Using the current forward estimates, Intel’s share price looks to rise to high $60s by 2020 and low $70s by 2021."
4302640,2019-11-05,AMD Set To Dominate Intel Server Technology Through 2020,Leaked Intel roadmap suggests that Ice Lake server chip is unlikely to be competitive with AMD Rome. AMD Rome will be an easy winner in 2020 against both Intel Cooper Lake and Ice Lake server products. AMD prospects continue to make AMD one of the best semiconductor stocks to own for 2020.
4303143,2019-11-06,Intel: 2 Reasons For Optimism,Intel reported third quarter results recently that produced record growth for its data-centric businesses. The company also announced it was adding an additional $20 billion to its share repurchase authorization. Intel has been paying a dividend longer than several other large cap tech names. Strong performance from the Data Center Group and shareholders returns should make Intel a very appealing stock to investors.
4303732,2019-11-07,Intel: Better Lucky Than Good,
4307777,2019-11-19,Intel Powered By Solid Earnings And An Attractive Valuation,"Intel's stock is trying to break above $60 per share once again. This level has been a strong resistance in the past. This upside move is being fueled by better than expected earnings. The stock is still very reasonably valued at current prices. A declining PC industry and growing competition from players such as AMD are key risk factors to watch. Nevertheless, the risk vs. reward ratio in Intel's stock looks attractive as long as management keeps leading the company in the right direction."
4309335,2019-11-26,Intel: Time For A Dividend Raise,Payout ratio expected to drop this year. Share count reduction should help here. Free cash flow generation remains high.
4310294,2019-12-03,Intel Drives Autonomously Into A Glorious Future,"With the rollout of 5G next year, there will be a multitude of new technical possibilities. Accordingly there will be a multitude of opportunities for companies to earn a lot of money here as well. One area of this is autonomous driving, in which Intel has positioned itself very well so far. Overall, I think that the expensive acquisition of Mobileye could definitely pay off in the long term. This is indicated in particular by the latest growth figures."
4310433,2019-12-04,Intel Vs. Advanced Micro Devices: Not A Zero-Sum CPU Game,"Since 2017, Intel has lost 10% PC CPU market share and 5% server market share to AMD. The current analysts’ estimate suggests that Intel may lose another 2% CPU market share to AMD in the next 2-3 years. Market share gain is more important to AMD than to Intel as AMD has a much smaller market share than Intel to start with. AMD’s shares are currently trading at a premium relative to Intel shares, reflecting AMD’s forthcoming CPU market share gain. Despite a projected 2% market share loss to AMD, Intel shares will still gain from the annual 5% growth of the CPU space."
4310943,2019-12-05,Intel: Currently A Low Growth Dividend Stock - IoT Is The Future,"Intel's larger segments (Client Computing and Data Center) have recently struggled to grow. Intel's IoT segment's double-digit growth will take a while to have a significant positive impact on overall fundamentals. Overall company revenue and earnings growth are expected to be below average in 2020. However, new acquisitions in IoT could help transform the company for the long-term."
4311631,2019-12-10,Intel's 7.5% Total Yield Will Push The Stock Higher,"In October, Intel's board increased its share repurchase authority by $20 billion to $27.2 billion. This represents over 11% of its market value. Intel is also due to raise its dividend per share by the time it announces earnings for Q4. I estimate there will be a 5% dividend hike. I estimate that by the 2019 year-end, Intel will have bought back $12.9 billion in shares this year or 5.24% of its market value. FCF, at $17 billion, covers this. The dividend hike and 2.34% estimated dividend yield, plus the 5.24% buyback yield, Intel has an annual total yield for shareholders of 7.5%. The stock is worth $65 per share, +15% higher than today."
4311877,2019-12-11,Intel: Here Come The Custom Chips,"Whether Amazon’s Graviton2 will be the game changer for the CPU market remains to be seen, Intel has to be sensitive to the emerging trend of customers’ designing proprietary chips. Intel’s large cloud customer Amazon’s Graviton2 stands to take away $120 million immediate revenue from Intel. Google’s TPUs may take $650 million, and Microsoft’s FPGAs may take $700 million. The wide uses of custom chips are restricted by their customized nature. Intel has about 2% revenue exposure on the custom chips from the 3 cloud providers. Merchants developing their own proprietary silicon, i.e., Apple, should be a more alarming trend. Currently, Intel has about 4%, or $2.5 billion annual revenue exposure potentially to Apple’s SoC/SiP chips."

4316564,2020-01-13,Intel Offers A Lot Of Value - But Investors Are Looking In The Wrong Places,"One thing is clear, it is precisely the future that is traded on the stock exchange and not the present (and certainly not the past).
         Given that, I have already pointed out in individual analyses the various new technical possibilities that will become increasingly important with the rollout of 5G this year.
         At the CES this week, Intel unveiled some interesting things about Mobileye and Intel's automotive business.
         Investors can find a lot of value here, because the automotive business has the potential to become a catalyst for extreme future growth."

4317872,2020-01-20,Intel: PC Strength Could Lead To Q4 Beat,"Intel guided the fourth quarter’s PC business to be flat, at best. IDC reported an """"impressive"""" 4.8% growth for the quarter. Global server shipments are expected to rebound from a better-than-expected 1.4% decline in 2019 to 6.6% growth. This could form the basis of solid 2020 revenue growth. Given this information, Intel has a low bar to clear to beat guidance and raise 2020 expectations. Supply issues notwithstanding."
4318760,2020-01-23,Intel Hits Another Home Run,"Company blows away Q4 2019 estimates. 2020 guidance strong for Q1, mixed thereafter. 5% dividend raise, a little smaller than expected."

See how nearer term challenges are being offset by DCG growth and valuation."
4319243,2020-01-27,Intel Earnings And Stock Dependent On Unpredictable Cloud Cycles,"Intel owed its impressive Q4 beat entirely to the cloud service providers. Intel’s quarterly results are increasingly dependent on the cloud’s unpredictable buying and digesting cycles. While this increases uncertainty and volatility around earnings and quarterly growth, the cloud remains Intel’s biggest growth driver over time. Intel’s 2020 earnings will be highly atypical from a seasonality perspective, but Intel was conservative in its guidance."
4319161,2020-01-27,"Continue To Expect Earnings Upside For Intel, Good Sign For AMD On Tuesday","Intel reported a blowout quarter. It's a good sign for AMD, which reports on Tuesday. Underlying demand trends look strong. Intel's guidance sounds conservative."
4319647,2020-01-28,Intel: Boom Goes The Dynamite,Intel blows Q4 results out of the water. Stock surges 8% on Q4 release. Intel is due to push for new all-time highs previously set in 2000 after completing a slow and steady grind back to the $70 range.
4319540,2020-01-28,Intel: Swan's Luck About To End,Intel beats Q4 analyst estimates by a wide margin. The chip giant saw data-center group revenues beat estimates by $800 million. The 2020 guidance is supportive of the forecasted protracted slowdown due to AMD grabbing market share in the data center space throughout the year. Investors should fade the stock rally as Q4 2020 sales will dip 10%.
4319492,2020-01-28,An Update On Intel's Buyback And Total Yield Effects On Its Valuation,"I wrote an article on Intel in mid-December arguing that Intel stock's total yield of 7.5% would push the stock to $65 per share. The stock has hit that target price. The company reported buybacks and free cash flow close to what I expected. It also raised the dividend per share to $0.33 per share quarterly, up roughly 5%. This is a short update on the stock's implied value, now that management has said they intend to pay out 100%+ of free cash flow over the year to shareholders. I estimate INTC stock is worth $71 on the upside, and has a downside risk of $52 per share. Later in the year, if a new dividend per share increase is apparent, I will raise the valuation."
4320785,2020-02-02,Chasing Intel,"Intel’s recent price movement has been mainly driven by multiple expansion than by actual financials, indicating that the market has shifted its attention on future growth. The valuation attributed to current fundamentals should be reasonably stable. Yet, the future fundamental value depends on Intel’s ability to deliver the new 10nm products as scheduled. If investors only pay for Intel’s current quarter financials, the share is worth about $59. If investors also pay for future fundamentals, Intel's shares should be valued around $74. Since Intel has a track record of delaying the 10nm launch, investors only paid up to 89% of the full fair value of the forward fundamentals. Looks like market prices say that """"this time will be different,"""" as Intel's share price has moved higher toward forward financials level.  Thus, Intel's shares should have another 11% upside."

4321159,2020-02-04,Nvidia Faces Huge Threat From Intel's Chiplet GPU Approach,"Despite being a new entrant to discrete GPUs, Intel is innovating its way into the market. Intel’s chiplet approach to GPUs brings all the (same) benefits as AMD’s Epyc Rome: process advantage, higher yield, cheaper cost, higher performance, lower power and earlier time to market. Intel's multi-GPU approach might give Intel an edge in mobile. Nvidia trades at a premium in the market, but the company's competitive environment will escalate from manageable to severe. Market share erosion could follow. With increased competition, dwindled and unclear growth aspects, and a high valuation, Nvidia doesn't offer a clear investment proposition. The 'Tesla factor' aside."

4322891,2020-02-10,Micron's X100 'Bomb' Will Benefit Intel,"Intel’s 3D XPoint Optane product will receive competition from Micron (as Mr. Stephen Breezy described recently). While Micron’s X100 has great specifications, Micron is several years behind Intel’s development and commercialization. Moreover, the X100 is an SSD and not the more disruptive DDR4 DIMM form factor. Hence, it looks like Micron's X100 will not make many splashes. Competition will be good to grow the overall storage-class memory segment and increase overall Optane adoption. This is (especially) beneficial to Intel as it has no stake in the DRAM."

4326757,2020-02-25,Alpha Trader Talks 'New Paradigm' Tech With Mark Hibben (Podcast),"This week's Alpha Trader features hosts Aaron Task and Stephen Alpher talking tech with Mark Hibben of Rethink Technology. Also up for discussion are the continuing coronavirus developments. A sizable economic slowdown now seems assured, and that's brought the potential for another round of rate cuts back into play. While the market averages may have brushed off much of the cornoavirus concern, Task notes about half the stocks in the Nasdaq are in bear markets - that is off 20% or more from 52-week highs. So take away the MAGA names and high-flyers like Tesla and Virgin Galactic, and it's already pretty ugly out there. Hibben isn't scared away by the gaudy one-year returns for a lot of the tech names he holds. He reminds that the big gains follow the major losses seen in the last few months of 2018. Still, Hibben acknowledges valuations are getting a little perky at these levels, and he's not finding a lot to buy right now. What Hibben calls new paradigm semiconductor companies (mostly Apple, but names like Samsung and Huawei also fit) are those that design most of the processors put into their products. At first derided as a Steve Jobs folly, Hibben argues that the shift has been perhaps the major reason for the massive profits at Apple over the last decade."

Not surprisingly, several of those announcements are focused on 5G. Intel made several different announcements focused on adding computing power and specialized resources that new 5G networks require at multiple points along the network path. There's no doubt that Intel is serious about making its presence felt in 5G."

Intel has pulled in its goal to become #1 silicon provider for base stations by a year to 2021 (40% market share) with design wins with Nokia, ZTE and Ericsson. Networking will become a $25 billion market by 2023, and was a $5 billion business for Intel in 2019. Intel's revenue will accelerate driven by 5G adoption.

4327718,2020-02-27,The Intel-Nio Deal Provides A Strong Argument Against The Shorts,"Funding has been a much-discussed topic with regards to Nio. Nio is of highly strategic importance to Intel Mobileye, since Nio will manufacture Mobileye’s robotaxis. Intel views robotaxis as a necessary precursor to consumer AVs and is investing for leadership. Intel Mobileye's close partnership with Nio could be seen as a vote of confidence in the company. Moreover, if Nio's ability to fulfill its commitment to supply Mobileye's robotaxis becomes untenable, Intel may take action. This could be an argument that Nio seems safe from substantial downside risk."

This is disappointing as the potential hoarding period is longer, as Intel will see significant pressure on other parts of its business as well. Contrary to grocery chains and other stay-at-home plays the impact seems less lasting for Intel compared to other players, as second half numbers probably start falling amidst economic reality.

Robust IoT, cloud and AI related demand will support processor and semiconductor growth rates for years to come. Clear investor accumulation evidence and upside momentum trends support a bullish argument."
4355217,2020-06-23,It's Time To Short Intel: I Can't Watch The Bubble Any Longer,"Apple's Silicon announcement is significant because not only does it mean lost revenue but it highlights a trend. The company's data center and desktop CPUs are losing, even from an x86 standpoint, to AMD. The company has some exciting businesses, however, they don't justify the company's valuation."
4355453,2020-06-24,Intel: Dividend Growth Investors Should Take Note,"Amidst all the noise surrounding Intel's competition, it continues to thrive quietly with free cash flows growing at ~11% CAGR over the last five years. The company is well-positioned to benefit from several secular growth trends, such as 5G, AI, IoT, and Autonomous Vehicles by way of its strong product roadmap. Intel offers a safe 2.15% dividend yield and potential for dividend growth as well as price appreciation. Hence, it is a great stock for long-term dividend growth investors. I estimate Intel's fair value at ~$81; thus, it is trading at a discount of ~25%. Therefore, I rate Intel a buy at ~$60."
4355408,2020-06-24,Apple Announcement Has Incremental Implications For Intel,"The long-rumored Apple move away from Intel has commenced. Impact on Intel could be relatively small in 2020 and 2021 depending on how Apple rolls out its PCs. However, the cumulative impact of AMD and Apple lead to significant headwinds for Intel in 2021."
4356159,2020-06-29,Intel: The Big Guys Are Bailing,"Institutions sold more of Intel's shares in the latest 13F reporting cycle. Also, institutional investors have been selling Intel stock and buying into AMD instead. This market dynamic should encourage readers and investors to reassess their investment thesis in Intel."
4356644,2020-07-01,"Intel: Ignore Apple, Buy The Dip","Intel stock price has been dipping along with the recent general market pullback and also due to some specific Intel news. Some negative catalysts recently have been the Apple switch, Arm supercomputer, and a former Intel Principal Engineer explaining why Apple switched. Work-from-home dynamics are still at play in Q2. I expect solid growth. Intel's market cap has fallen below TSM and is just ahead of Nvidia. Intel is a clear buy."
4356875,2020-07-03,2 Interesting Semiconductor Stocks: Intel And NVE Corp.,Intel and NVE Corporation are both semiconductor companies with a bright future at a low valuation. Intel is an industry leader that has to keep up with smaller competitors that want a piece of the market share. NVE Corporation is a small cap that wants to gain a larger piece of market share with a unique proposition. They both have large new markets to explore.

4357983,2020-07-13,Intel And Micron Are Two Likely Winners From Technology Stimulus,
4359501,2020-07-20,Intel: Low Bar To Crush Earnings,"PC sales were estimated to jump between 2 to 11% YoY in Q2. IDC and Gartner noted recovery after supposed Q1 supply chain disruptions. Intel had nonetheless (already) delivered a blowout Q1, so Q2 might be even better. If the cloud surged as much as the average SaaS stock this quarter, Intel should deliver an even greater beat. Tiger Lake will make Intel reclaim CPU leadership (in laptops), while Mobileye continues solid ADAS and AV progress. Second-half guidance could be relevant, as Intel withdrew full-year guidance in April."

4360739,2020-07-24,Intel Sends A Warning To All Tech Bulls,Intel shares tanked after results that seemed better than expected. The 7nm chip delay is certainly a big setback. But there are other reasons that the shares fell and those should serve as a warning to all technology bulls.
4361208,2020-07-27,Intel: Living On Borrowed Time,"Intel reported another strong quarter, but future prospects continue to worsen. The company announced a big delay in 7nm products, which aren't likely to reach market until 2023 now. The stock isn't investable as revenue estimates for 2021 and beyond start dripping lower."
4361167,2020-07-27,Intel Vs. Taiwan Semiconductor: What A Difference A Day Makes,"I respect and value other SA Contributors' extensive reporting of stock fundamentals, and so should you. Examples: an Investor’s Edge review of INTC’s delay on 7nm chip development, plus analysis by Trapping Value and Bill Maurer. Lots of fundamentals reporting and analysis, but little investor guidance. The one piece of guidance was a solution that TSM had solved INTC’s problem, and the delay would be good for TSM. What happened next? Here’s the comparison of our daily ranking of semiconductor stocks’ likely near-cap gains from the forecast population of over 2,800 stocks and ETFs, given just one day’s changes."
4361052,2020-07-27,Applied Materials: 2 Headwinds Following Intel's Call,"Intel suggested in its earnings call it may use third-party foundries to make 7nm chips following a 6 to 12-month delay in production. The delay at Intel will be a headwind for Applied Materials, which generated 12% of its revenues in F2019 from Intel. A move to TSMC will be a headwind for Applied Materials, since TSMC's focus on EUV equipment means fewer etch deposition sales from Applied Materials."
4361029,2020-07-27,Intel In Turmoil - Don't Buy That Dip,Intel had a great Q2 but investors ignored that as the forward-looking market sees challenges ahead. Intel's process roadmap vis-a-vis TSMC is playing out as we have been forecasting for the last several years. The market is only now realizing the gravity of the situation. We suspect there is no turnaround for Intel until the company spins off its fabs.
4361027,2020-07-27,Intel Is Still Incredibly Overvalued,"Intel is still incredibly overvalued - it's incredibly unlikely to double as some analysts predict. The company has pushed back its 7 nm process, meaning it is now less likely to be competitive with AMD. At the same time, customers are incentivized to use ARM. For the long run, there are some risks to the thesis. However, there's no sign of them happening."
4361021,2020-07-27,Buy Intel Now,Intel's recent sell-off was disproportionate. The company is more profitable than ever. The short and mid-term look exceedingly good for the company.
4360928,2020-07-27,Intel: Returning To A Corona Discount,"The latest earnings report for Intel, while positive in some respects, highlighted fundamental issues in the company's 7nm fabrication. As a result, the company's share price tumbled. This has turned into an interesting prospect, and what I consider a long-term potential discount - the company is close to as cheap as when I bought it years ago. As a result, I currently consider Intel a """"Buy."""" There may be pressure in the short/medium term, but I see things returning to a premium in the longer term."
4361340,2020-07-28,Why It Is Not Yet Time To Write Off Intel,"Delay in launch of 7-nanometer technology is a big setback for Intel. Loss of PC and laptop market share and potential margin contraction are other big challenges. The company, however, came up with good second quarter numbers and decent fiscal 2020 guidance. Intel's strong balance sheet and focus on conserving capital are also key positives. Finally, the current demand for 10-nanometer technology far surpasses that of 7-nanometer technology."
4361311,2020-07-28,"Dark Clouds As 7nm Delayed, But The Intel Show Will Go On","As expected, Intel reported stellar earnings. Intel also provided upside full-year outlook. But Intel uses Q2 earnings to announce significant 7nm issues: 12-month yield slip and six-month product delay. Comes after a 3-year 10nm delay and years of management saying it has learned from 10nm and would be a one-off. With Intel unable to transition timely to 7nm, investment theses will have to be reviewed. Intel and AMD both have access to TSMC. Worst case, TSMC - the fab so beloved by AMD bulls - will supply Intel. The Intel show will go on."

4362223,2020-07-30,The Worst-Case Scenario For Intel Is In The Price,"Buying Intel, you get an experienced, financially strong player with exposure to growth stories in the semi industry, not the losing side in the battle for notebooks. It had been obvious even before this earnings report that Intel would be losing its market share. This is priced in the least expensive valuation in the sector. After the drop, the worst-case scenario is seemingly priced in the shares. From this level, there are more upside risks than downside."
4363699,2020-08-02,The Chippening: Intel Has No Wizard,"Intel is stumbling due to defects in the R&D process leading to its next generation of chips. The CEO is a finance nerd, not an engineer, so he is not helpful. The company needs a chip nerd, not a finance nerd. Intel's competition is run by a true chip wizard, and the company cannot compete against such a wizard without one of its own - and wizards of such caliber are rare."
4364158,2020-08-04,"Intel: When It Comes To Investing In Quality, There's Opportunity In Bad News","Intel is a quality company currently experiencing a period of adversity. So far, that adversity has had no impact on financial results. The market has overreacted, creating opportunity."
4364711,2020-08-05,Intel: The Nanometer Games,"Intel reported 20% YoY revenue growth. Intel is a healthy company satisfying the ever-growing compute demand. Intel shares plunged after delaying 7nm by 6-12 months. Let’s not lose perspective: Analysts are not electrical engineers, neither does Intel sell nanometers; it sells products. While a hiccup, it does not take away from Intel's financial growth opportunities. Not all nanometers are created equal, and neither is a nanometer a predictor for product or financial performance."
4364603,2020-08-05,"Intel Places Multi-Billion-Dollar Wafer Order At TSMC, Murthy Gone","On the verge of Intel's 7nm delay, rumors have surfaced of a multi-dollar order at TSMC for 6N wafers and 5N for Ponte Vecchio. This confirms Intel's plans to expand outsourcing. Intel purportedly also considering leveraging 5N and 3N for CPUs. Intel might move to 3N ahead of AMD. Intel reorganizes manufacturing as Murthy gets the boot (following the 7nm issues)."
4365252,2020-08-06,"Forget Apple, Intel Is A 3x Better Investment","Apple and Intel are both cash flow machines. Which could be the better investment? They have about the same 5-year revenue growth, but Intel has over 2x higher net income and EPS growth. Since Intel has a lower base revenue, it also has arguably higher continued growth prospects. Both have a similar dividend payout ratio. Apple has higher growth, but Intel's yield is almost 3x higher. Concerning value, Intel trades at about 10x P/E vs. Apple’s 31x. Intel is a 3x better investment. I propose MAGIA as the $1 trillion U.S. companies."

Admittedly, though, that 42% better annual return came at the cost of incredible volatility. At the current 12% discount to fair value, Intel is a potentially good buy for anyone seeking dependable dividends that are expected to grow modestly over time."
4367834,2020-08-11,Intel Tiger Lake Will Likely Crush AMD,"In a previous article, I suggested that Intel was likely to crush earnings. Intel delivered. Of course, since market share evolves slowly, this might not be fully representative of the current product competitive environment. In the past quarter, many have voiced that AMD currently has CPU leadership, a sentiment further ‘proved’ by Apple’s switch away from Intel silicon. However, Intel’s upcoming Tiger Lake will likely crush AMD in single-thread performance while being competitive in multi-thread, despite having half the number of cores. AMD’s purported ‘leadership’ is merely one of appearance: its products simply contain ‘more’ cores, not ‘better’ cores. AMD does not have a moat."

4368876,2020-08-14,Intel Against $5T Big Tech: The Clear Winner,"On Thursday, 30 July, 'Big Tech', totaling $5T in value, reported earnings and smashed estimates. Nevertheless, the Thursday before, a small $0.2T technology company reported profits comparable to three of the four Big Techs (Facebook, Amazon, and Google). The company, called Intel, hence won against Big Tech in value with a wide margin. It should be a clear buy. However, as a high-tech company, its tech might be too advanced, since the sell-off indicated the company is misunderstood."
4368718,2020-08-14,"Forget The FAANGs, Intel's Where The Value's At","Intel can be seen as the unloved child of the technology sector, trading at a much cheaper valuation than its peers. However, Intel continues to deliver in terms of growth, and it will enjoy tailwinds from IoT, AI and 5G. I fully expect the share price could more than double within the next two years."

AMD is involved in two duopolies but with much larger rivals."
4369384,2020-08-18,Intel Chip Advancements Show It's Up For A Competitive Challenge,"It would be easy to see how some people may think Intel is in serious trouble, as several signs have not been promising. Though Intel announced strong second-quarter earnings a few weeks back, the stock tanked when the company revealed yet another problem and delay for its 7nm manufacturing process. It's clearly way too early to count Intel out. If nothing else, the significantly more competitive environment in which it finds itself seems to have inspired it to be doing some of its best work in years."
4369707,2020-08-19,Intel: Price Correction An Overreaction,"In its earnings briefing, Intel highlighted issues with its process technology resulting in delays for next generation processors. Its stock price has dropped by 20% since the announcement, which we determined as a huge overreaction by the market. The current market price reflects a 48% decline in CCG revenues, while our calculations indicate a mere 7.8% decline even after taking account of potential future losses in CPUs. We applied a sum of the parts valuation approach to determine the group’s fair value, accounting for the delay as well as the Intel's non-CPU segments."
4369956,2020-08-20,Intel: Buyback Isn't A Strong Enough Signal,Intel announces a $10 billion ASR plan after spending the last five months not buying shares.

4370803,2020-08-26,Intel Appears To Offer A Wide Margin Of Safety At Just 10x Earnings,"Intel shares sold off after its recent Q2 report and appears to have found support in the $48 area. The 10x earnings threshold has served as long-term support for the stock, and it appears to be holding up in 2020 as well. It is a cyclical play that doesn't offer the most reliable dividend growth prospects in the short term. However, long-term investors looking for exposure to the semiconductor space should consider buying this stock into weakness."
4371283,2020-08-27,Intel Reminds Me Of Apple In 2016,"Apple's revenue and net income growth has been in the low single digits since 2016, and the PE was 10. Similar to what analysts' current predictions are for Intel. The business outlook is uncertain, but the company is likely to still be in business in 10 years. There are also many growth opportunities in the IOT, 5G, autonomous sectors. Even if Intel doesn't grow at all over the next 10 years, just the buyback activity should lead to high single-digit rewards for shareholders.

4371929,2020-09-01,It's Time For Intel To Spin Off Mobileye,"Given the high flying recent tech valuations, it's time for Intel to seriously consider spinning off Mobileye. The company is struggling to reach a double-digit P/E ratio, but it is continuing to generate strong cash flow with earnings growth. The potential for shareholder rewards with or without Mobileye is significant. We recommend investors pay close attention to this."
4372661,2020-09-04,Intel: A Market Leader At A Great Price,"Intel stock's steep price drop due to the 7nm delay is an opportunity to buy. Intel has leading market share in personal computers and servers, a moat that is very likely to be strengthened by the new tiger lake architecture processors. AMD maybe closing in on the desktop processor market, but decline of desktop sales began 10 years ago. Unparalleled R&D spend positions Intel well to achieve early entry into new markets. Trading under 10 PE, Intel offers a great entry point for long term investors."
4373631,2020-09-11,Intel: A Spin-Off Of Mobileye Would Be A Bad Idea,Intel should not be considering spinning off Mobileye just yet. The chipzilla would be foregoing on immense growth potential and also on its strategic vision if such a move occurred anytime soon. Readers and investors should rule out this possibility for the time being at least.
4374889,2020-09-17,Intel: Tiger Lake Adds To The Bull Case,"Lots of positive takeaways from Intel's Tiger Lake launch, particularly on the performance front. The rebranding exercise across Project Athena (now Intel Evo) and for the overall company signals intent. Potential outsourcing of its advanced products to TSMC likely mitigates future production delays. ~$10bn accelerated buyback signals belief in its near and long-term prospects, and adds to downside protection. Risk/reward appears highly favorable at these levels."
4376091,2020-09-24,Quit Wasting Your Time With Intel,"INTC was sold off hard this summer on weak earnings. With no growth on the horizon, this is entirely justified. Intel is fairly valued, so a rally from here will prove difficult."
4376326,2020-09-25,Intel - Oversold On Delay Announcements,"Delays in new process nodes have left Intel oversold. The fundamentals remain strong for Intel to deliver strong cash flows in the foreseeable future. With a high cash return, investors do not have to rely on the market to earn a return."
4376732,2020-09-28,Nvidia Vs. Intel: The Semi Battle Of The Decade,"Intel and Nvidia are on a collision course. Competition between both semiconductor giants will intensify. This could lead to headwinds for both. Nvidia is on track to acquire Arm for $40 billion, getting access to the world’s most widely used architecture and top-class CPU design teams. Arm is also trying to gain a foothold in (Intel's) data center, where Nvidia has also increased its efforts with Mellanox and GPUs for AI. Intel, meanwhile, is developing a leading top-to-bottom GPU software and hardware stack, targeting all the same verticals as Nvidia. The stakes are very high for both. Intel's biggest risk is its much higher revenue base, while Nvidia has a much steeper market valuation to lose."
4376824,2020-09-29,Intel: The Market Is Missing The Point,"In the 2020s, Intel could go down the path of IBM or experience a resurgence as Microsoft did in the 2010s. Intel's transformation to a data-centric business is in full swing and the explosive growth in data could help the company maintain solid revenue growth throughout the next decade. The pessimism surrounding Intel has created a great buying opportunity for long-term dividend growth investors. According to my estimates, Intel's data-centric business alone is worth more than the current stock price. Hence, I rate Intel a buy at $50."

This caused the 'horrible' quarter that was 'merely' in line with guidance. The reason Intel did not beat can entirely be ascribed to weak results in non-core businesses, such as the 3D NAND unit which Intel is selling. Intel's results also have nothing to do with AMD. Intel's growth drivers, cloud and comms, will be up strong in the double digits in full 2020. Bob Swan is very bullish on 7nm, and said the defect is """"fixed"""".

The tone during the earnings call on the 7nm process has improved substantially and grown more confident. Intel is unlikely to outsource its core CPU chip production to TSMC but it could do so for other products like GPUs. Intel's cash reserves and cash flow generation dwarf that of main rival AMD and Intel has abundant financial firepower to catch up with TSMC.

Ice Lake-SP has been delayed by at least 1-2 years and continues to trail behind the competition significantly. This CPU embodies everything of the failed Intel in recent years. In 2019, Intel touted Aurora as the first 2021 exascale supercomputer. However, the 7nm GPU was already delayed, and the 10nm Sapphire Rapids CPU is also delayed into 2022.

Yet, the newly announced IDM-2.0 business model under new CEO Pat Gelsinger’s leadership may be able to turn its prospects around over the next five years. Intel will return to its foundry roots with """"Intel Foundry Services"""" under IDM-2.0. The company will expand its manufacturing capabilities to global peers, effectively taking advantage of rising semiconductor demand. The company's five-year product roadmap will also bolster its ability to capitalize on market opportunities made available by global digital transformation trends ahead. The next five years will be pivotal for Intel, as it continues to progress towards regaining its former glory as the industry leader. The materialization of Intel’s five-year growth roadmap is expected to catapult its valuation prospects back into the lead, with upside potential of more than 40%."
4455859,2021-09-17,Let The Weak Hands Sell Their Intel Shares,"Intel always sells off on the slightest bearish news. How to solve Intel’s seemingly perpetually low valuation? Markets are based on supply and demand. For the share price to drop, must mean someone is willing to sell their shares for a (low) price. Know what you own: Intel is the most innovative company on Earth. So don’t sell. This will create scarcity which will drive up the price. So only sell for a reasonable price/valuation, like Nvidia shareholders, for example, succeed in. I have previously suggested $210 as a price target."
4456269,2021-09-21,"Improving Outlook For Intel, But Not Quite A Buy","Intel is in the midst of a major turnaround effort. The current valuation indicates the market is not convinced. The Wall Street consensus is neutral, but the 12-month price target implies 17% upside (although much of this is because the shares have been getting cheaper). The market-implied outlook (derived from options prices) has improved considerably since my last analysis in January. I am changing my rating on INTC from bearish to neutral."
4456975,2021-09-24,Inside Intel's Quest For Transistor Leadership,"In a previous article, I discussed several technical aspects concerning Intel’s manufacturing operations, in light of the 7nm delays. Still, history could have turned out much differently than the current events. Intel had a grand plan for transistor domination and leadership. This article tells the (unsung) story of Intel’s quest for unquestionable process leadership that instead resulted in its loss of process leadership. Intel lost its leadership due to the absence (delay) of EUV lithography, but EUV has now become a mature technology. This means Intel can come back. Improved technology going forward will lead to a virtuous cycle of higher gross margin and fewer market share losses."

It is final, Microsoft demands TPM 2.0 for Windows 11. This could help Intel improve its forward revenue CAGR of 0.59%. BIOS updates cannot transform TPM 1.2 chips in to TPM 2.0 hardware. Windows 365 and Office 365 are most likely powered by Intel Xeon server processors."
4457363,2021-09-27,AMD And Intel Offer Similar Returns - Focus On The Risks,"Semiconductor stocks benefit from long-term tailwinds, but steep returns are not guaranteed. INTC and AMD will deliver high-single-digits returns in the coming years, I believe, but due to different reasons. The two companies come with different risks, and investors may want to decide what type of risk they are willing to take on."
4457761,2021-09-30,Intel Stock: Scalability Can Drive Revaluation,"This article analyzes Intel from the perspective of its profit sustainability and scalability. This analysis examines the two most important aspects of profit sustainability: return on capital employed and the marginal efficiency of capital. The results show that INTC not only earns a consistently high ROCE in the past but is still perfectly scalable at its current stage, indicating sustainable and even improving profit. Such prospects of profit scalability and sustainability can drive a dramatic change of the compressed valuation."
4457792,2021-10-01,Nvidia's Valuation Isn't Justifiable After Reading Through Intel's Numbers,"Some valuations don't make sense and after someone said to me that they like Nvidia at this level because it has more room to grow, I needed to investigate. Intel's market cap is less than half of Nvidia's, yet Intel generates much more revenue, profit, and free cash flow. At some point, valuations will matter, and there is a point where paying much for future growth isn't a good allocation of capital. One of these companies trades at a 2.85 P/S, 11.93 P/E, and 13.47x price to FCF while the other is valued at 23.47 P/S, 72.64 P/E, and an 82.69x price to FCF."
4458384,2021-10-04,Intel Is Still Worth Investing In,"Moore’s Law is declining in importance and pace (proof in article). Even if TSMC retains any lead, it won’t be a significant one. There’s more than manufacturing. Intel didn’t grow despite a multi-year process advantage during the PC era. Intel’s current, data-centric strategy is the right one and does provide growth. Intel’s end-markets are growing (cloud, AI, 5G, IoT). Intel has also added new businesses in areas such as XPUs (GPUs, Habana), connectivity (silicon photonics, Ethernet), memory (Optane), and Foundry Services. Mobileye might become larger than even the PC and data center. Intel is valued as if it has no growth (prospects), but I disagree."

4459655,2021-10-13,Intel: Moment Of Truth,"Almost a year after becoming CEO and setting out the technological strategy for Intel’s resurrection, Pat Gelsinger will soon have to detail the financial roadmap at Investor Day. In the near-term, Intel is destined to have a few stronger quarters of growth given easier comps ahead. Intel may beat Q3 estimates by $1-2B. Intel has an exciting roadmap that can compete with the best in the industry (AMD, Nvidia, TSMC), but how much growth will this deliver? Intel's stock price is at the same level as a year ago despite a significantly improved technology outlook. This means the risk-reward for betting on Intel's comeback has greatly improved."

4461584,2021-10-25,Intel: Gearing Up For A Bumpy Ride To Glory,"For Q3, Intel's results were a mixed bag: a slight miss on revenue and a beat on earnings. However, Intel tanked ~11% (on Friday) due to weak medium-term margin guidance. Although the demand environment remained strong, Intel's Q3 results were marred by supply chain issues. Pat Gelsinger guided for better growth on lower margins going forward (i.e., a price war is coming). The next two-three years will be investment-heavy for Intel as the semiconductor giant scales up its foundry business and attempts to cut the process leads established by TSMC and Samsung. The launch of Alder Lake, Sapphire Rapids, Alchemist Arc GPUs, and Ponte Vecchio can reignite near-term growth at Intel; however, I am not buying Gelsinger's promise of delivering 5 process nodes in 4 years unless I see some material progress. The IDM 2.0 strategy has great potential and Intel's depressed valuation affords ample margin of safety to investors, and so, I continue to rate Intel a buy for dividend growth investors at $51."

4463376,2021-11-01,Intel: Unquestioned PC Leadership,"Early this year, I predicted that Intel's upcoming Alder Lake CPU would be game-changing and achieve leadership in all segments against AMD. New benchmarks of Alder Lake for laptops confirm that the CPU even beats Apple M1 Max in both single and multi-threaded performance. AMD is far behind. This means that Intel for the first time in years has achieved unquestioned leadership with a CPU. The AMD threat is finished."
4464383,2021-11-02,Intel Will Be The Top Semiconductor Stock Through 2025,"Intel invests more in research and development than its top four peers combined, setting the stage for disruptive innovation and outperformance. The company is now leveraging its R&D with an aggressive growth strategy christened by a $20 billion investment in two state-of-the-art semiconductor foundries in Arizona. Intel’s fastest growing opportunities are on the innovation frontier including AI, 5G network transformation, and the intelligent and autonomous edge. In autonomous driving, Intel’s Mobileye platform continues to secure design wins at major US and global automakers with 25 OEMs and 49 production platforms. Intel’s low valuation provides the opportunity for a highly-skewed return profile to the upside offering an asymmetric risk/reward tradeoff."
4465433,2021-11-04,Intel: Even Cheaper Now,"Despite reporting solid quarterly results, Intel dropped in the last few weeks.

4467067,2021-11-08,Intel Is Relevant Again,"The company has launched the last of its 10 nm processes and is moving towards 7 nm (AMD 5 nm). The company's Intel Foundry launch has the potential to enable the company to earn revenue toward its capital expenditures and profits. The company also is launching other sectors, such as its Intel discrete GPUs, that could help it take advantage of shortages in the market. In a world where everything takes several years, Intel is cheaply valued for a long-term growth bet meaning less downside but higher upside."

4467278,2021-11-09,Intel Stock: Disregard The Message And Messenger,"Intel guidance for Q4 2021 blamed the semiconductor shortage, but I am dismissing those articles as an excuse with no validation. While Alder Lake will help Intel in the Desktop PC market, its CPU shipments were just 18.6 million Desktop CPUs versus 49.3 million Notebook CPUs in the latest quarter. Historic problems and delays with chip production at 10nm will only amplify against TSMC and Samsung foundry powerhouses at 3nm."
4468040,2021-11-10,Intel: Pay For The Chip Business And Get The Foundry Business For Free,"Intel's stock price fell significantly after its recent earnings release due to market concern of its increased capex ahead. This article will argue that the market has overacted, and thus creating an opportunity to buy a high-quality business at a substantially discounted price. This article will show that at this point we essentially pay for its chip business only and get its foundry business - a significant growth opportunity - for free. Even for its chip business, it’s selling at a substantial discount of more than 50%, further widening the margin of safety."
4467917,2021-11-10,Intel's Rise To Market Leadership Is Likely,"Investing in Intel was not the right decision for past years; however, I believe times are changing.

Intel proved that it is capable of achieving its goals with the successful release of the Alder Lake CPU. I believe Intel provides investors with value, dividends, and growth opportunities."

4468806,2021-11-12,Intel's Huge Expected Capital Spending Gives Dividend Growth Investors Pause,"Intel Corporation has benefited from strong demand for semiconductors of late, and we expect that will continue being the case going forward, though challenges are mounting. Competitive headwinds are growing, for one, and Intel is ramping up its capital expenditures to keep up, particularly as it concerns its manufacturing capabilities. We expect Intel's free cash flows in the medium term will face headwinds, though its net operating cash flow generating capabilities continue to impress. The company's dividend remains well-covered by its free cash flows in the near term but we caution that Intel will likely lean on its balance sheet to keep making good on those payouts over the coming fiscal years. Intel's free cash flow generating abilities and ultimately its dividend strength may eventually recover to levels seen in recent fiscal years, but we're still concerned."
4469981,2021-11-16,Intel Stock Forecast: What's The Outlook As Market Share Is Lost To AMD?,"Intel has been losing market share to AMD in the PC processor and server processor market. AMD's recent win in the data center processor market with Meta Platforms could point to further market share loss for INTC in this segment. INTC's consensus earnings forecasts have been slashed significantly in recent months, and the company is not expected to witness a substantial earnings recovery until 2024 at the earliest."
4471631,2021-11-23,AMD: Still The Datacenter King,
4471828,2021-11-24,AMD Is Not Intel,"Currently, AMD is valued at (nearly) Intel’s market cap. I will conclude that the relative valuation between both is untenable in the long term. Although some may assume AMD could grow into its valuation, in the logical scenario, Intel would gain a lot more market cap. Even using conservative estimates (and generous ones for AMD), Intel would still be 3x larger than AMD in 2030. With the best-case AMD scenario priced in, this means Intel has higher prospects for alpha. Intel stock price could quintuple to $1 trillion."

Intel Agilex FPGA achieves 30-50% higher performance and 2x performance per watt than Xilinx Versal. Intel further leads in innovation due to leadership transceivers, chiplet and 3D packaging, and AI performance. This means there is one clear winner. Intel is the unquestioned leader in FPGAs. Xilinx-AMD could be in trouble."
4473721,2021-12-06,Intel Corporation: What The Wide Yield Spread Means For Retirement,"The dividend yield spread between Intel and 10-year Treasury rates is now exceeding 1.3%, almost the widest level in a decade. For such a stable dividend stock, such a wide spread provides several key advantages for a retirement account seeking current income. The wide spread provides a comfortable cushion against inflation and interest rate uncertainties. Furthermore, such a wide yield spread is also very likely to lead to a sizable price appreciation in the near term."

Mobileye spinoff is a great move to unlock shareholder value. But questionably timed insider stock purchases damage Intel management's already strained credibility.
4474916,2021-12-13,"Intel's Mobileye: Strong Headwinds From Competitor SoCs, Particularly In China","Mobileye and self-driving cars are not CEO Gelsinger's strategic directions for Intel. Intel's IPO of Mobileye will generate cash for the company to build more fabs and to get back on track against AMD and other competitors. The IPO comes at a time when Mobileye is facing strong headwinds from established companies and Chinese startups making autopilot chips. The later the IPO, the more headwinds Mobileye will face along with the spectre of a lower IPO valuation."
4474846,2021-12-13,Intel: Mobileye IPO Will Likely Create World's First Public Robotaxi Company,"Intel announced its intent to take Mobileye public in mid-2022, reportedly at a $50B valuation. The move creates the world’s first pure-play robotaxi company. Intel will maintain majority ownership in Mobileye. This will unlock significant shareholder value."
4474906,2021-12-14,Intel: Mobileye IPO Could Be A Masterstroke,"Intel is spinning off Mobileye via an IPO in mid 2022 to raise capital for its ambitious growth plans. In this note, we will discuss the logic of this transaction. Mobileye is one of the leading players in autonomous vehicle technology, which means it should command a much higher multiple than Intel. At ~9x Price-to-FCF, Intel is massively undervalued, and as such Mobileye's valuation is suppressed. The IPO is likely to act as a significant value unlocking event for Intel. According to my analysis, Mobileye could quite easily fetch a valuation of $50-100B in the current market environment. Hence, Intel could raise a significant sum by selling just a minor stake. Even after the IPO, Intel will continue to control Mobileye with a majority stake, and Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, will be shaping Mobileye's future as the Chairman of its Board. Hence, Intel is getting the best of both worlds with this deal. I rate Intel a strong buy at $50."
4475827,2021-12-17,Intel: My Worst Trade Of 2021,
4475964,2021-12-19,Driving In Traffic - Intel,"Fed Chairman, Jerome Powell did a masterful job last week of delivering a dovish message that was fundamentally hawkish. Investors should now pay attention to companies that serve markets of significant demand and are well-positioned financially. Intel fills the bill given the unabating need for chips, its war chest of cash within a well-capitalized balance sheet, and low P/E."
4476675,2021-12-23,AMD Vs. Intel: I Was Wrong About AMD,"I recently considered AMD’s server roadmap to be too weak. However, I made the mistake of only using Intel rumors and not AMD rumors. AMD’s 256-core Turin (Zen 5) could spoil Pat Gelsinger’s """"unquestioned leadership"""" plans. Hence, I reverse to neutral on Intel: let Intel ship their chips first. In the long term, AMD’s success is dependent on TSMC. Conversely, process leadership is a requirement for Intel to be able to overtake AMD. Intel has a solid PC roadmap, but until it regains process leadership (in 2025+) and shows proof of being a """"data center-first"""" company, Intel might at best trade sideways."
4477041,2021-12-28,Intel Focuses On Unlocking Massive Shareholder Value,"Intel has announced the spin-off of Mobileye at a valuation equivalent to 25% of the company's market capitalization. The company is also focusing on releasing top of the line CPUs, which are competitive with AMD, and launching its new discrete GPU with TSMC. The company expects to maintain and grow existing revenue and cash flow, with an already low multiple. Additionally, the company expects to pass TSMC and Samsung on process miniaturization going into 2025, helping long-term returns."
4477621,2022-01-02,Downgrading Intel,"After about two quarters into his """"dream job"""", CEO Pat Gelsinger already started to amass criticism for his inability to turn Intel around. Pat Gelsinger never claimed he could turn the ship in one year. From the beginning, he had maintained an outlook into 2024-2025. In the near term, Intel’s only focus is regaining technology leadership. Intel now is like AMD in 2013-14, three or four years before Zen even launched into the market. This does lead to the conclusion that Intel could trade sideways for several more years, especially since the new businesses (Habana, Xe, IFS, and Mobileye) have yet to gain scale. Downgrading the stock: let Intel launch a 20A chip first to prove they're really back, then the financial results may follow, and then the stock performance."
4477675,2022-01-03,Intel: Mobileye IPO Is A Bad Sign,"Intel proposed an IPO for Mobileye valuing the auto tech firm at $50 billion. Mobileye only generated $1.3 billion in revenues during '21, questioning the valuation target. The stock is now expensive at 15x '22 EPS estimates and an IPO move appears a desperate attempt to raise cash for costly new fabs."
4477918,2022-01-04,Intel's Profit Drivers And Our Barbell Retirement Model,"In this article, you will see how and why we use the Intel Corporation stock in the short-term end of our barbell retirement portfolio. It earns a very competitive return on capital employed (“ROCE”), and a fundamental DuPont analysis shows its potential to further expand the ROCE. In a bull case scenario, its level of ROCE is projected to be in the top tier even when compared against the FAAMG pack. And several catalysts afoot could support such a bull case, such as its fab initiative and Mobileye IPO. Its potential return in the next few years is projected to be in the double-digit range (ranging from 11% to 15%)."
4477879,2022-01-04,AMD Vs. Intel Stock: Which Is The Better Buy For 2025?,"Intel will likely spend more than $100 billion in building new fabs in the next 5 years.

4478636,2022-01-09,Intel: An Assessment For Long-Term Investors,"At first glance, the rise of Asia has threatened US technological hegemony. China last year has achieved 16% self-sufficiency, well below its 70% target by 2025. Additionally, China last November imported $265.9 billion worth of semiconductors. Therefore the two factors above imply that the fears and threats of China are exaggerated. Technically speaking, Intel's 10nm chips align with the 7nm of its competitors with similar transistor density and production. Node names do not relate to the size of a transistor. A few years of underinvestment and lack of technological focus and vision have led Intel to uncharted territories. Unfortunately, there is no quick fix, and 'turnarounds' take time. However, the Captain, Pat, is a talented and visionary CEO, but the management needs to execute flawlessly the plan to regain Intel's power. Intel's $200 billion CAPEX investment over the next decade is feasible, and the restructure of the business model is essential to regain market leadership."

Moreover, Mobileye announced the world’s first L4 consumer vehicle, launching in early 2024. Mobileye has a substantial technology and first-mover advantage. If Tesla bulls can attribute a $1T market cap to their company’s non-existent robotaxis, then initiating Mobileye at a $1T price target (representing 20x upside) seems reasonable. Mobileye could hence become one of the greatest investments of the coming decades."
4479135,2022-01-12,Intel Stock Forecast: What To Watch For In 2022,"Intel's Alder Lake seems to be competitive on both desktop and mobile.

NVIDIA and AMD also continue to consolidate their leadership in the GPU market with their entry-level discrete graphics. We discuss what investors should look out for in 2022."
4479194,2022-01-12,Intel's Mobileye Divesture Is Ingenious,"Intel's decision to bring Mobileye public brings massive opportunity for Intel investors. Mobileye's technological prowess and the leadership in the autonomous vehicle market creates an immense opportunity in coming years. The divesture will raise cash for Intel to support its turnaround efforts while Mobileye will be valued away from the shadows of slow growing Intel, creating growth and value for shareholders. Overall, I believe the decision to take Mobileye public is a great move."

4482913,2022-01-31,Intel's Battle For Relevance Masks Its Allure,"Intel has been in a straightjacket for at least a decade, allowing rivals to create distance with Intel. Intel has gone from being a market leader to a distant challenger. The industry has pattern of boom and bust yet there are strong reasons to believe in the sustainability of this cycle. Market pessimism has priced Intel for a 40% decline in profitability despite the company’s history of growing shareholder value. This gives investors a 68% upside on the current price."
4482901,2022-01-31,Intel Has A Moat From The Government,"The U.S. government has a strong incentive in a home-grown chip industry, and it's working hard to build one. Intel is rapidly expanding capital spending towards $30 billion a year as it seeks to build its own foundry business. We expect profits to be muted for the next several years, but with significant expansion potential for the late-2020s. Overall, Intel is an undervalued investment with significant earnings potential at current prices."
4483376,2022-02-01,Intel: Cloud Collapse,"As expected, PC revenue declined slightly. However, contrary to anyone’s expectations, data center had a miraculous blockbuster record quarter. Intel has responded firmly to the AMD bulls. Nevertheless, digging deeper reveals appalling cloud performance, offset by 5G (and enterprise) saving the day. Cloud has posted its fifth consecutive double-digit decline. Ice Lake is ramping significantly slower than Skylake and Cascade Lake. Data center still has to rely mostly on 14nm into 2022, which explains the cloud collapse. R&D is now on a $16B run rate. Intel added a monstrous 11K employees (mostly engineers) in 2021 to rebuild the execution machine going forward."
4484405,2022-02-04,Intel: Why We Remain Long-Term Bullish After Its Earnings Report,"Intel offers an optimal combination of a wide and stable moat, strong financial safety, and excellent perpetual growth in the long term.

Intel will have the most advanced process technology (again). Chips will be built from smaller chiplets in 3D. This means computers will be designed like building with lego blocks. Intel again leads this change. Data centers will be interconnected through light instead of electrons with integrated silicon photonics. Only Intel has this futuristic technology.

And recent corrections provide entry opportunities for both. This article provides an in-depth comparison so you can pick the one that suits your risk profile and time frame. The year 2021 finished with AMD setting an all-time CPU market share record as Intel gains in desktop and notebook PCs. Intel’s acquisition of Tower Semiconductor accelerates its vertical integration with direct access to a wafer foundry."
4501114,2022-04-13,Intel: Full Transparency - Arc GPU Flop,"Intel will (finally) be reporting the results of its restructured businesses, giving full transparency: PC, data center, networking, graphics, foundry, and Mobileye. The Arc launch was a flop as there are still no high-end parts, but seems to ramp pretty quickly to perhaps a (nearly) 10Mu 2022 exit rate. Since Intel remains in the investment phase through 2024, investors should judge Intel on its technology milestones rather than financials (which will still grow). Since the stock price won’t follow this advice, investors should be smarter than the market and buy the dip. Semiconductors are not a cyclical market and neither is Intel a PC company. Pat Gelsinger expects growth to continue for the next decade."
4501472,2022-04-14,Intel May Have Bottomed Out Despite The Rising Rate And QE Cut. Here Is Why,"Wide-moat Intel is fairly valued with a P/E at 9.70x compared to its rivals AMD at 39.30x and NVIDIA at 60.05x. Product roadmap to Intel 20A Architecture, Fab expansion in Ohio, launch of ARC GPU, and the venture into ARM should provide high growth opportunities for Intel in the long term. INTC commands high LTM EBITDA margin of 42.90% compared to AMD at 20.3% and NVDIA at 39.76%. Cash from operations have also been growing at a 5-year CAGR of 11.17%, generating over $30 billion in LTM 2021. I recommend buying INTC stock at the $43-46 range and a price target of $64.31. Intel should provide investors with lower downside risk (low valuation) and higher upside potential (high growth opportunities)."
4502951,2022-04-22,Intel: A Promising Turnaround Story For Patient Investors,"Intel faces significant execution risk and breaking through the noise is essential for justifying any investment. The company has a history of sound capital allocation decision making with a ten-year ROIC average of nearly 17%, almost three times its WACC, which leads to substantial shareholder value creation. The first signs of turnaround progress are evident, and the CEO has started delivering results. However, there is still a long way until Intel regains its leadership. The most important near-term catalyst for the company is bringing Intel 4 (7nm chip) into production by the end of 2022 and proceeding with massive volume production in 2023."

So, the bear thesis goes, even if Intel executes its leadership process roadmap flawlessly, Intel won’t be able to ship these nodes. In reality, there is no evidence Intel is last in line and ASML has aggressively ramped EUV production over the last few years (and will continue to ramp further). Even using extremely conservative estimates, Intel should be able to produce twice as many CPUs as Tiger Lake, which was Intel’s fastest ramping notebook CPU ever. I provide a bull case scenario where I would overnight quadruple my Intel stake."

4504994,2022-04-29,Intel Stock Is A Buy Whenever It Falls,"Intel is continuing to maintain stability in its business through diverse product offerings. INTC is pursuing future growth potential through investing heavily in foundry services. The company's innovation is on track and continues to move in the right direction. For investors, Intel may provide stability and dividend with long-term growth potential."
4504965,2022-04-29,Intel: A Potential Turning Point,Intel's stock price has been virtually flat since the end of 2017. IDM 2.0 could be the starting point in Intel's turnaround by focusing on creating more manufacturing capacity to service its own products as well as those for fabless designers. Current entry may be advantageous for long-term shareholders.
4504956,2022-04-29,Intel: Still A Have Not,"Intel reported another quarter of weak results despite beating lowered guidance. The company forecasts a tough June quarter with another big EPS hit and revenues below expectations. The stock isn't exactly expensive around 13x forward EPS estimates, but Intel isn't appealing with the margin compression and negative trends."
4505681,2022-05-01,Intel: Disaster Averted As Headwinds Priced In,"Intel revised its Q2 guidance downwards but kept its full-year FY22 guidance intact. The company doesn't expect its near-term headwinds to be structural. However, the market didn't like the uncertainty in its Q2 guide and knocked its price down further. We observed that INTC stock last traded near its critical support level, which should help to defend against further declines. Coupled with a relatively reasonable valuation, we think its Q2 headwinds have been priced in. Therefore, we revise our rating from Hold to Buy."
4506164,2022-05-03,"Intel Q1 2022: Short-Term Uncertainty, Long-Term Clarity","INTC's latest earnings release continues to be soft - no major decline or increase in the revenue overall. The continued OPEX and CAPEX investment has not been well received by investors, especially during this liquidity crunch. Expect INTC to make more progress on IFS, DC, Auto, and more in the future, and we are seeing some early success on various technologies."
4507011,2022-05-04,"Intel: Waiting For Godot, Stock Going Lower, Sell Now","We rate INTC as a sell as we believe risk-reward for the stock remains unfavorable in the next few quarters. We see a significant risk of PC TAM normalization impacting Intel's top line and gross margin in the near term. While we expect share loss in the PC business to moderate during 2H22, we expect INTC to experience incremental price pressure due to lower units. We recognize the turnaround effort, but we think its IDM 2.0 strategy will take longer than expected. We believe INTC will need at least 2-3 years before offering a meaningful competitive offering in the Angstrom era to its foundry customers."
4506621,2022-05-04,Intel: Double-Digit Growth Galore,"Intel had a solid (boring) quarter that has been misinterpreted in many ways. Most people thought Intel revenue declined, but in reality, nearly all important segments grew double digits. No one buys Intel for its PC business. The stock dropping on downside Q2 guidance, despite Intel reaffirming its FY guidance, tells everything about the myopic short-sightedness of Wall Street. Intel is expecting a strong data center through 2022. If the data center collapse (due to AMD share gains) isn’t happening this year, it will never happen. Buy the dip on overblown myopic concerns."
4508340,2022-05-07,Intel: Q1 Earnings And Buffett's 10x Pretax Rule,"This is an updated coverage of an analysis I published in August 2021 on Intel Corporation. The main update is twofold. First, it has just released its 2022 Q1 earnings and some of the financials in my original analysis need updating. Second, the business fundamentals have also changed in several respects. Both its fab initiative and Mobileye have achieved major milestones, and it also announced new R&D and fab investments in Europe. All told, it is a growth stock priced as a value stock. It is similar to owning an equity bond with ~9% yield and coupon payments that grow up to ~9% per year."

But its investments could pay off in the coming years. There is also potential to become more efficient, e.g. by cutting R&D expenses in areas that are not generating a lot of growth anyways. The valuation isn't high, and the dividend yield is at a multi-year high. But there is not necessarily a rush to buy now, as the turnaround will take time."

However, weakening sales trends, a possible recession, and a commitment to spend $20+ billion on new plants in America will likely zap earnings for years. A low valuation with flat to negative income growth is usually best avoided in your brokerage account. Intel could be a value trap."
4515932,2022-06-02,Intel: Falling Knife Or Great Opportunity?,"Compared to its competitors NVIDIA, Texas Instruments or Advanced Micro Devices, Intel underperformed in the last ten years. Intel has been reporting mediocre results for several years now, but has a clear strategy towards double-digit revenue growth. But even when the strategy is not working out, Intel seems to be at least fairly valued and the stock is at a strong support level."
4516296,2022-06-03,Intel: The Tower Semiconductor Acquisition Is A Positive For The Supply Chain,"The industry outlook for semiconductors is tainted by supply chain woes, with the bulk of the manufacturing done in East Asia. In this respect, Intel's bid to acquire Israel's Tower Semiconductor substantiates its intention to expand the foundry business to become an end-to-end contract manufacturer. Intel's current and future presence in the U.S., Asia, and Europe signifies that it should play a key role in the semiconductor supply chain. The Tower acquisition together with a collaboration with Samsung Electronics is positive to gain a firmer footing on American soil. Both Intel and Tower are buys at current prices."

Furthermore, we analyzed its new discrete GPUs and determined its slight disadvantage to (8.4%) AMD and Nvidia (6.5%) based on its average benchmark performance but projected its growth of 29.2%. Lastly, we believe its acquisition of Tower Semiconductor and capacity expansion could bode well for its IFS segment growth at 232% in 2022. Projecting the revenues of these 3 new segments, we expect them to generate $20.4 billion in revenue for Intel by the year 2025."

I have identified an unprecedented (double) acceleration in Intel’s data center roadmap as proof point that its execution is strongly improving. Namely, the data center is moving to new nodes much quicker than historically going forward, while the process roadmap itself has been accelerated too. Combined with the new scary Sierra Forest product line, 2024 will mark the start of a new era of sustained and unquestioned Intel leadership."
4517227,2022-06-08,Intel: Don't Catch The Falling Knife,"Intel forecasts weaker results in the current quarter compared to guidance just at the end of April. The chip giant continues to lose market share on the premium chips while chasing an expensive foundry plan leading to substantial gross margin pressure. The stock isn't attractive, even at 52-week lows, due to the falling EPS profile."

At no point since Pat Gelsinger took over has the Intel thesis been to buy Intel based on next quarter’s earnings results. Intel remains a multi-year bet on a return to leadership. Evidence is mounting that Intel will be successful. The stock might become cheapest right before it gets expensive.
4517480,2022-06-10,Is Intel Stock Nearing A Buy Opportunity? It Depends On Your Time Horizon,"Although Intel share price fell by nearly 20% year-to-date, the drop was far less than those registered by the high momentum peers. From a business point of view, management is executing well across all segments with some short-term challenges still in the way. After taking into account exposure to outside risks and current valuation, Intel is well-positioned to outperform its peers."
4518182,2022-06-13,Intel: Back Below 2018 Lows - But Still Not A Buy,"This is a dedicated price action analysis of Intel stock. We noticed INTC stock is still testing its multi-year support zone but had not observed any potential bear trap reversal. INTC stock remains in a dominant bearish bias. Therefore, investors should accord a higher significance to its negative flow without a reversal signal. Therefore, we believe revising our rating from Buy to Hold is appropriate.

Higher rates, fewer sales, and potentially compressed margins. However, INTC is now priced like a value stock and TSM is in the unfortunate position of being priced like a high-growth stock. Historically, these stocks have traded at similar valuation levels, but COVID-19 has dramatically pushed TSM stock higher, in my opinion, this may revert back to the historical moving average. Long INTC and Short TSM is my recommendation for aggressive investors to capture an apparent relative value mispricing."
4519998,2022-06-23,Taking Advantage Of Monetary Tightening: A Semiconductors Pair Trade,"The unprecedented level of monetary intervention created a significant opportunity for momentum stocks which is now reversing.

According to my assumptions, despite high growth rates, AMD is overvalued. Its fair value is $61.90, while it is currently trading at $78. According to my assumptions, Intel is highly undervalued and has a fair value of $99.12. Considering a 30% margin of safety, Intel is a buy without any doubt.

However, the solid investor meeting plan and stock sell-off led me to upgrade Intel to buy. Several very recent and new hiccups have caused Intel to damage shareholder trust. Despite what Pat Gelsinger has claimed, Intel is still not doing what it said it would do. Although the stock has become very cheap with a nice dividend, I downgrade Intel from buy to neutral until there is tangible evidence of improvement. Despite the recent setbacks, the fundamental (long-term) turnaround thesis of Intel regaining process tech leadership still stands."
4522448,2022-07-08,Intel: Market Gives Away Its Foundry Business,Recent corrections have brought Intel's stock price to a 52-week low. Valuation is so contracted that investors not only are paying for the chip business at a discount but also getting the foundry business for free. Its acquisition of Tower Semiconductor will provide direct access to a chip foundry. And it has also officially acquired the land it needs for the Ohio manufacturing plant.
4522701,2022-07-11,Intel: National Security Requires Success - CHIPS Act Passage Is Only A Matter Of Time,"Intel has been a rather pathetic investment of late, due primarily to technological leapfrogging by competitors and new CEO Pat Gelsinger's planned CAPEX binge on foundry's. While the next few years are very likely to see tepid bottom-line results, I argue that the time is now to begin building a position. The CHIPS act is nearly certain to pass once the political dance ends. Frankly, national security of the US and Europe likely depends on Intel's ability to succeed in its turnaround."

Intel's growth rate is pitiful compared to better innovators like Nvidia and AMD, and now it wants the US government to help it compete with foundry king, Taiwan Semiconductor, oof! This report reviews Intel's business, compares it to peers regarding growth and valuation, and discusses Intel's foray into foundry - including its strong support for passing The CHIPS for America Act."

If there are any surprises, they may be to the downside given rumors of further Sapphire Rapids delays, despite Intel aiming to ramp this CPU faster than Ice Lake. Intel expected to announce a new IFS whale foundry customer in H2'22. Securing AMD, Nvidia or Apple could be the real surprise but is exceedingly unlikely."
4524569,2022-07-20,Intel's And AMD's Places In The Chip Cycle,"My last chip article analyzed Nvidia and Micron to argue that we are currently in the downturn stage of the cycle. This article extends the analyses to Intel and AMD, and the thesis is twofold. First, I foresee the current downturn stage to last into late 2022 or early 2023 for Intel and AMD as well. And I have seen signs of their valuation reaching bottoms already. Second, among these four, you will see that Micron has suffered the most and Intel the least severity during this chip cycle. Based on these results, I will also discuss the implications for valuation, projected returns, and risk control in the chip space."

4526817,2022-07-28,"Intel: R&D Needs More Bang, Needs More Buck","Intel is facing massive competitive pressure as AMD, NVIDIA, and TSMC ramp up their research and development budget. Over the past five years, the R&D budget has increased by 260% in NVIDIA, 190% in AMD, and 80% in TSMC while Intel’s research budget grew by a paltry 22.5%. The rapid increase in R&D by Intel’s competitors will be felt by the company in the next few product cycles. Intel will need to get more bang for the buck through its R&D department in order to meet the changing competitive landscape. Investors betting on new Intel products should be cautious over this alarming trend because we could see more attractive products by Intel’s competitors due to higher R&D investment."
4527414,2022-07-29,Intel: That Dividend Will Have To Go,"We stayed out of Intel as the headwinds were too strong. The current quarter was weaker than our worst expectations. In our view, there are now three major risks that bring the dividend sustainability into question."

The stock remains expensive based on an earnings stream falling into the $1 to $2 range.
4527357,2022-07-29,Intel Shares Crash After Yet Another Poor Quarter,Intel reported another disappointing earnings report that investors have become accustomed to seeing. The company continues to lose market share to both AMD and NVIDIA. Could this be the Kitchen Sink quarter to lower expectations.
4527832,2022-07-30,Intel's Q2: A Nightmare Quarter,Intel’s Q2'22 earnings card was a nightmare. Intel’s business is under pressure from deteriorating PC shipments. Trends could get worse in the second half of the year if a recession weighs on consumer spending. Intel significantly cut its guidance for FY 2022 and expects much weaker results from top to bottom. EPS estimates are subject to down-revisions. The trend will likely remain negative and may weigh on shares of Intel.
4528182,2022-08-01,Intel: No Half Measures,
4528157,2022-08-01,Intel: Armageddon,"Everything imaginable went wrong for Intel in Q2: demand collapse, inflation, ongoing competition from AMD, a fatal Sapphire Rapids bug, the Arc GPU clown show, and inventory reductions. Nevertheless, I will make the case the report wasn’t as horrible as it may seem. Q2-3 will mark the bottom for sure. Adding 5.3k net new employees, Intel had the best hiring quarter in perhaps its entire history, eclipsing even the 5.1k when Intel absorbed Altera in 2016. As has been my thesis since Pat Gelsinger joined, the turnaround will still take multiple years. For reference, Intel tanked in 2020 because of the 7nm delay, a node that is still not ramping. The bottom, both technologically and financially, is definitely 2022. Either watch Armageddon from the sidelines or take advantage of the dip."
4528736,2022-08-02,Intel And Qualcomm Q2: CHIPS Act Impacts Not Priced In,"The CHIPS Act passed the senate vote almost with Intel and Qualcomm’s CY Q2 results. Hence, their CY Q2 results did not price in the potential impacts (or benefits). And my view is that neither does the market. This article, therefore, analyzes the impact of the CHIPS Act on them. By choosing a fab chip business and a fabless one, the results can also illustrate the market mispricing on other chip stocks."

4528189,2022-08-03,Intel: On The Bargain Rack But Not Going Out Of Style With A 3.92% Yielding Dividend,Intel has a strong balance sheet that can absorb decreases in operating margins while management executes their turnaround plan. The bear case should be taken seriously because even though Intel has historically generated large amounts of profits its stock hasn't been reflected in its operational achievements. I think if you have a 5-10 year investment timeline INTC could be interesting from an income and capital appreciation perspective.

4531330,2022-08-08,Intel: Forcing A Bottom For Long-Term Dip Buyers,"Intel put up a horrid show for investors for Q2, as macro headwinds and execution issues led to a battering that sent INTC back to levels last seen in 2017. But, management is confident that Q2/Q3 could be the eventual bottom for its financial model. It also reiterated the long-term guidance at its February Investor Day. Our valuation model suggests that the market has de-risked INTC significantly to reflect higher execution risks. Therefore, if Gelsinger & team could execute well, a material re-rating could follow. Therefore, we revise our rating on INTC from Hold to Speculative Buy, as we believe downside risks seem limited from the current levels."
4531588,2022-08-09,Intel: A Price Hike Solution,"While Intel’s Q2 results were disappointing with revenue growth of -22% YoY, we believe the reported price hike of Intel’s products could provide some cushion to its growth in 2022. With the reported price hikes, we compared it with our previous analysis where we saw its CPUs increasing on average by 9% (PC) and 20% (server). For its NEX segment, we forecasted its revenue growth higher based on ASP and unit shipments at a 5-year average of 21.1% compared to 16.7% previously. We also compiled the average GPU reported prices amid the price increases by AMD and Nvidia and forecasted its GPU revenue with price hikes."

However, for prospective investors, it is more fruitful to look at the future beyond the near-term. Intel’s course will reverse by 2025 by retaking process leadership. Hence, Intel could make for a successful investment if the stock price follows. In hindsight, 2022 may turn out to be the technological, financial and stock bottom.

But Intel's challenges appear structural, as the company has lost market share and profit margins during the past few years. This is a value trap and investors should not pay a one-year forward P/E of x14, or a P/B of close to x1.5.

It is evident that INTC continues to lose critical market share in the desktop, notebook/ mobile, server, and overall x86 segments to AMD and ARM. Thereby, emphasizing the management's swift turnabout to the foundry market by 2025, though we are uncertain of Intel's eventual success then. However, INTC bulls may potentially nibble at these near-bottom levels for long-term investing, given the maximum pessimism surrounding the stock."
4536006,2022-08-21,"Intel Corporation Yields Over 4%, Now's The Time To Buy",Intel has a long history of paying dividends. Intel rarely yields more than 4%. Intel offered excellent returns when it yielded 4% in the past.

Bears point to decades of failed projects and misallocated capital while bulls will tell you that Intel stock trades for less than 17x 2023 earnings, giving INTC a low hurdle to clear. We look at the good, the bad, and the ugly of Intel stock."
4536458,2022-08-23,Intel: It'll Get Uglier Before It Gets Better,"Intel continues to trade at levels near its 52-week low despite Brookfield's recent investment into its foundry build-out efforts, which provided validation for its IDM 2.0 strategy. The stock's latest slump underscores investors' skepticism over Intel's near-term ability in delivering on its promise to turnaround the company under CEO Pat Gelsinger's leadership. In addition to broad-based macro headwinds, Intel is also showing elevated execution risks following consecutive quarters of underperformance resulting from internal operational mishaps. The following analysis seeks to explore the near-term fundamental prospects across Intel's core operating segments and gauge their implications on the stock's outlook."
4536780,2022-08-24,Intel: Protecting The Dividend At All Cost,Intel announced a major $30 billion investment partnership with Brookfield Infrastructure Partners. The chip giant will improve cash flows while giving up future profits for the investment. The company now protects the $6 billion annual dividend payout for several years. The stock remains a Sell until Intel solves the fundamental problems with the business.
4536579,2022-08-24,"Intel: No Pain, No Gain","Investors are making too much ado about the recent Intel product delays since these products were conceived under prior management. The investment thesis was that Pat Gelsinger would turn the Intel ship around by improving execution. Since the jury is still out, the thesis stands. Intel's current P/E valuation is misleading: if Intel succeeds, there will be strong future returns on current investments (which weigh on current earnings). Since current earnings are deflated, investors can trade near-term pain for long-term gain."
4536597,2022-08-25,Intel: Looking Attractive At 5-Year Lows And 4% Yield,"Shares of Intel are now trading at 5-year lows and the declining price has pushed its dividend yield past 4%. Intel is making over $100 billion of capital investments over the next decade in the semiconductor manufacturing space. Prior to 2030, Intel will be making chips for other companies and will have the ability to take market share away from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Intel has generated $659.18 billion of revenue and $154.64 billion of profits over the previous decade, and I think this is still a buying opportunity for investors."

Essentially, SCIP allows Intel to build two fabs for the price of one. The catch is that only one fab’s profit will go to Intel, to other’s goes to Brookfield. There is no free lunch. As such, the program does not seem to benefit shareholders at all long-term. While the CHIPS Act handouts in the U.S. and E.U. should be more effective forms of financial engineering, Intel will need real engineering to restore its former glory."
4538823,2022-09-03,Why Intel Is Now Too Cheap To Ignore,"Data growth is driving the need for more compute power, and Intel is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. The company's IDM 2.0 strategy and co-investment with Brookfield gives it a flexible capital structure that can protect its dividend and hasten its payback period. While Intel has its headwinds, I believe they are more than priced into the stock. The current price is very attractive for long-term investors."

4539309,2022-09-07,Forget Intel And Buy These 2 Better High-Yield Blue-Chips Instead,"Even the greatest companies in the world can become value traps that can result in several lost decades for investors. Intel has delivered negative inflation-adjusted returns for 23 years. That appears to be the case with Intel, whose 58% 2022 EPS crash has justified its recent price collapse. Despite $168 billion in growth spending through 2025, analysts expect just 2.2% long-term growth from INTC and 6.9% long-term annual returns, barely better than a 60/40. In contrast, CSCO and SCHD are far superior high-yield dividend growth blue-chips. In fact, CSCO is the 2nd largest holding in SCHD, while INTC isn't in the gold standard of high-yield ETFs at all. CSCO is growing 3X faster than INTC and has an AA-rated balance sheet. SCHD has delivered market and aristocrat beating returns for 11 years, and analysts expect it to keep delivering 12% returns for decades to come. It's packed to the rafters with world-beater high-yield blue-chips and has none of the growth risk that INTC investors have to accept."

4540194,2022-09-11,CHIPS Act: Intel's Gain And Taiwan Semiconductor's Pain,"The primary goal of the CHIPS Act passed by congress last is to make the U.S. less dependent on semiconductor chips made in China and Taiwan. Admittedly, the full impact won’t be felt several years down the road. However, it is quite clear to me that domestic chip stocks, especially those with a fab operation such as Intel, will be the major beneficiaries. In contrast, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing not only won’t benefit too much but also would suffer headwinds on multiple fronts. With heightened global geopolitical tensions, I see the act sets a tectonic shift in motion for the chip ecosystem similar to the deglobalization since 2008."
4541049,2022-09-14,Intel: Be Greedy When Others Are Fearful,"Intel reported disappointing second quarter results and had to lower guidance for fiscal 2022.

4541010,2022-09-14,Intel Highlights Key PC Platform Innovations For 13th-Gen Core CPUs,"Intel unveiled news about several intriguing innovations on the platform technology surrounding the CPU for their upcoming 13th-Gen Core, code-named “Raptor Lake.”. Raptor Lake was designed at the company’s Israel Development Center. The new chip is also being manufactured in Israel at the company’s Fab 28, as well as at other locations around the world.

Execution issues also seem to be largely short term in nature, however, competition will continue to intensify. The rest of 2022 will most likely remain challenging, however, taking the long-term perspective, Intel appears attractive at current levels."
4540970,2022-09-14,Intel: Mobileye Trap,The Mobileye IPO price has been cut by 40% to start. Intel continues to face delays and lower valuations for assets impacting the value of the stock. Investors should avoid the stock until the business has hit rock bottom and an actual turn has occurred.
4540877,2022-09-14,"Intel: Down, But Far From Out","Intel stock is down about 40% year-to-date. The stock has still not reached its March 2000 Tech Bubble high. While valuations were stretched during the Tech Bubble, the business has grown considerably in the ensuing two decades, and now trades at a discount to the broader market. Beyond initiatives motivated by the CHIPS Act, the company has made several key investments in new technology, materials, and processes to extend the quickly approaching limits of Moore’s Law."
4541648,2022-09-17,Intel Just Bottomed,"Intel, after the recent share decline due to declining earnings, currently does not look any more or less expensive than in the past. However, the reason earnings have declined is due to a sharp increase in investments to fuel future growth (which is causing a temporary decline in gross margin). The underlying profitability of Intel’s business is unchanged (if anything, it is actually increasing because of CHIPS Act). Hence, the shares have declined by more than warranted. Intel is objectively undervalued. Take advantage of the dip (base price target $60, bull case of $90). No heroic assumptions or even turnaround is required (turnaround PT $150). Don’t bypass this gift from the market."
4542183,2022-09-20,Nvidia Vs. Intel: Where To Buy The Dip?,"Is there a dip buying opportunity for either Nvidia or Intel? Which stock is better positioned for a share-price rebound? In my opinion, Nvidia is taking advantage of emerging technology trends, while Intel is playing a more defensive strategy. Nvidia has a more exciting product portfolio than Intel, grows faster and is more. With reference to the past 10 years, Nvidia stock outperformed Intel by some 3,240 percentage points. Although I think it is too early for semiconductor stocks to rebound, I would feel much more comfortable buying the dip in NVDA than INTC stock."

4543594,2022-09-28,Intel: Perfect Storm,"Intel revenue is unlikely to drop further, meaning that the market doesn’t need to further discount the current decline (which is now priced in). Gross margin has also bottomed. Intel has the most ambitious roadmap in the industry. The turnaround hype is warranted. Intel still generates massive amounts of cash, as illustrated by the >5% dividend yield. Investors should not conflate the dropping stock price with actual progress in the business, which remains as much on track as it was in early 2021.

We believe the market has demonstrated to CEO Pat Gelsinger that it remains unmoved by his transformation plans amid further market share losses to its keen rivals. However, investors need to ask whether a speculative mean-reversion opportunity is still possible for investors willing to tolerate near-term downside volatility. We discuss why such an opportunity is reasonable at the current levels and suggest the critical levels for investors to watch closely."

We want the company to get serious about its spending, and Intel is taking steps to improve its fiscal state, including using a foundry model, and cutting staff. We believe Intel's Q3 results will come in below the company's guidance just given the pain experienced by the sector in Q3. The dividend is secure, and better days are coming in 2023."
4546197,2022-10-12,Intel Introduces Internal Foundry Model,"A few months after introducing the novel, innovative (although questionable) semiconductor co-financing program, Intel is at it again. This time, Intel has introduced the “internal foundry model” as the next phase of its IDM 2.0 strategy. This means Intel’s design teams will become the customers of its own fabs, on equal footing to its actual foundry customers. Besides these financial engineering gimmicks, what ultimately matters is if Intel remains on track to its roadmap, which luckily it is. Nevertheless, splitting off of the design and manufacturing groups behind an Iron Curtain does open the alluring possibility of consecutively spinning off the fabs (or the design teams)."

4546966,2022-10-17,"Intel: Gelsinger Got Hit In 4 Different Ways, Simultaneously","Intel’s current market cap is back to where it was in 2012 (about $100B). To make the picture even uglier, it has also cumulatively retained $110B of earnings. In other words, even if its CEOs have done nothing, the retained earnings alone should have more than doubled its market cap. Gelsinger, unfortunately, is the one who inherits this miserable scorecard. He’s hit by 4 different issues, simultaneously. It’s inappropriate to say it's unfair. After all, a CEO’s job is to deal with whatever comes his/her way. But it’s fair to say that the issues are not his making and he has been making all the right calls to address them in my mind."

Intel shares now yield nearly 6%, and the stock could be offering a generational buying opportunity. Intel management and the turnaround have not proven themselves yet, but the upside reward appears to greatly outweigh the potential downside. I think the only way to invest in Intel is to buy in stages, and let the dividend help to reduce your cost basis over time."

The risk is high that Intel will have to cut its FY 2022 guidance a second time."
4547508,2022-10-19,Intel: Dividend Should Be At Risk,"Intel continues to struggle to generate the free cash flows to cover the dividend. The chip giant faces a scenario where the quarterly dividend contributes $1.5 billion to a net debt build.

4547463,2022-10-19,Intel's Mobileye IPO Is Turning Into A Disaster,"Intel management is aggressively pushing to realize the Mobileye IPO - despite a very unfavorable time and unappealing terms. Intel acquired Mobileye, a sensor maker based in Israel, about four years ago and grew the company as a leading supplier for AI-chips and software for driverless cars. Mobileye's valuation first crashed from $50 billion to $30 billion and now to $14 - $16 billion. In my opinion, Intel's aggressive push to IPO MBLY is the latest sign that management might fail to take decisions that align with long-term value accumulation. If the company needs cash, I personally would like to see that the 5% dividend is cut in half. Remain """"Sell"""" rated."

Free cash flow will be very weak this year, which is why the company was hoping for a big cash windfall from its Mobileye IPO. But timing has been very bad there, which is why Mobileye will not be the major cash source Intel hoped it would be."
4548178,2022-10-21,Intel: The Bad Can Get Better,"Intel has been caught up in the bear perfect storm: the financials are deteriorating due to weakened demand just as Intel is going all-in on investing in fabs and R&D. The thesis remains that investors may be overly bearish due to extrapolating Q2/Q3 figures which include a one-time inventory correction. Contrary to popular opinion, the dividend is likely not at risk, although it may depend on how fast there will be a recovery in demand. While others may be ridiculing the collapsed Mobileye IPO valuation, this presents a very compelling entry point (in the bull case its robotaxi business becomes more profitable and hence valuable than Uber). Raptor Lake has a very strong CPU line-up, and the Arc launch represents a milestone for Intel's XPU strategy."

The real significance of Mobileye's planned IPO is that it could possibly mark the first step in Intel's plans to unlock the value of its emerging business segments. I retain my Hold rating for Mobileye; I see opportunities for INTC to create more value for its shareholders, but I am unimpressed with Mobileye's indicative IPO valuations."

This is because Intel, despite many tries, has failed for more than a decade to diversify to new large and growing businesses. This now presents a catch-22 situation. Without organic funding available to embark on the turnaround, Intel is having to cut costs, which was one of the reasons (corporate greed) it fell behind in the first place. Put differently, lower investments (layoffs) mean a significantly increased execution risk, which has been investors’ and analysts’ main concern with Intel for years. The Q3 earnings pop was completely unwarranted, as the financials are still trending downwards (and the reorganization misplaced). Beware the bear trap (more downside)."
4553372,2022-11-04,Intel: Buy The Pullback,"We are moving Intel to a buy from a sell based on our belief that the company’s financial performance will stabilize through 1H23 and could outperform expectations in 2H23. We believe the market has now priced in most of the weakness in the PC and cloud spending, as well as the market share loss to AMD and ARM-based CPUs. We still believe INTC’s PC TAM forecast of 270-295M units for 2023 remains too high in the current macroeconomic backdrop and expect a continued soft cloud spending environment. We are getting more constructive about INTC’s ability to execute in the foundry business and believe it could be a meaningful foundry player in the next 3 to 4 years. We think INTC stock may remain a little volatile in the near term, but we believe the stock provides an attractive entry point for long-term investors."

Nevertheless, the major delays pertained to products already in-flight prior to the CEO transition. The new roadmap items remain on track. It has been a true annus horribilis. However, this also means that it likely won’t get worse (with many improvements underway). This means 2022 will be the bottom instead of the first in a string of downhill years. Investors who can see the difference could make strong alpha going forward."

4560240,2022-11-23,Intel Could Double Revenue Once New Domestic Production Plants Activate,"Optimal market entries can be placed with Intel's stock price crossing crucial MACD positive technical analysis. Forward guidance suggests solid Intel returns for 2026 and 2027 as new fabrication plants come online based out of Ohio. Given that the CEO of Intel purchased a significant number of shares, it only confirms that Intel's leadership believes in the stock price over the long run."
4560049,2022-11-23,"Intel: The Good, The Bad, But Not Too Ugly","Intel is the market leader in CPUs with over a 60% share of the personal computing industry (The Good). Intel's Revenue has declined by 15% year over year (The Bad). The company generated mixed results for the third quarter as it beat both revenue and earnings expectations (but expectations were pretty low), so this was """"not too ugly"""". Intel stock is undervalued intrinsically and relative to historic multiples."
4560304,2022-11-26,Intel: Mr. Market Is Too Kind To The Kitchen Sink Guidance,
4561060,2022-11-29,Intel: Bottom Fishing Is Not An Investment Strategy (Technical Analysis),"INTC is in its worst sell-off since the Dotcom crash. Though I don’t see history repeating itself, it’s not a time long-term investors want to be invested in the stock. Bottom fishing is an ego-boosting tactic rather than an investment strategy, but everyone has the choice to feed their ego rather than their portfolio. In this technical article, I show important price levels and metrics that investors could consider for gaining an edge on the stock’s likely price action. This article focuses on technical analysis and based on those aspects, the stock is not yet offering a long-term investment opportunity. While I discuss a short-term buy-strategy, overall, I categorize INTC as a hold position."
4561024,2022-11-29,TSMC Vs. Intel: I Know Which One I'd Buy,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel are both cheap-looking stocks in the semiconductor industry. Both are mainstays of value portfolios. Intel is cheaper than Taiwan Semiconductor going by trailing multiples, but TSMC has better growth. Overall, TSMC looks like a better buy. As Warren Buffett says, """"better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."""""
4561623,2022-12-01,TSMC Vs. Intel: The New King Of The Hill,"When it comes to process leadership going forward, the only node that makes sense to evaluate is 2nm (TSMC N2, Intel 18A), since that is Intel's first leading-edge foundry offering. According to my estimates, 18A will be half a node denser while also being 12 months earlier to market. Intel will be the new king of the hill. Given Intel's currently deflated gross and operating margins, Intel also has the highest likelihood of multiplying its earnings, as any foundry growth will be at TSMC's expense."
4562153,2022-12-04,Chips Made In The USA: Buy Texas Instruments Instead Of Intel,"ASML estimates that by 2030 10% of global chip production will be inefficient due to Technology Sovereignty. The US Chips Act and similar acts around the world are large tailwinds for semiconductor manufacturers. Intel is often named as the prime beneficiary from the Chips Act, but I prefer Texas Instruments. In this article I'll explain why TI is a better business than Intel."
4562193,2022-12-04,Intel's Rebound: Technical And Fundamental Signs,"Intel stock recently showed strong signs, both technical and fundamental signs, of having bottomed in Q3. Technically, its stock prices staged strong rallies on large volumes. Fundamentally, its valuation is too compressed to ignore. Its PE is only in the single digits (5x ~ 6x) once its IFS becomes online even under extremely pessimistic margin assumptions."
4562572,2022-12-06,Intel: More Pain Potentially Ahead,CFO comments suggest street estimates may be too high. Cash flows in question as earnings set to drop. No reason to invest in Intel until revenue growth returns.
4563158,2022-12-08,2023 To Signal Intel's Comeback Against TSMC And Samsung,"Intel's success is crucial to the United States and European Nation's national security interests. Intel's progress has been great, and the company's turnaround efforts to regain leadership will likely be successful. Competitive and market downturn risks do exist, but the long-term opportunity for Intel is greater."
4564459,2022-12-14,Intel: Why I Fear A Dividend Cut,"Intel Corporation tends to announce dividend increases in January. While I expect a token dividend increase, I fear a dividend cut is not out of question. COVID highs are unlikely to be revisited, but free cash flow decline is nonetheless alarming."
4564778,2022-12-15,"Intel: The More It Drops, The More I Buy","Intel has seen its share of headwinds over the past year. However, it's transforming itself into an essential infrastructure company through its IDM 2.0 strategy. The recent drop in share price has pushed its dividend yield well above 5% and presents an attractive buying opportunity."
4564961,2022-12-16,Intel Likely Won't Cut Its Dividend: Here's How To Generate Extra Yield,"Intel Corporation has been getting a lot of attention for the wrong reasons. Fear of a dividend cut is unjustified, but the dividend will likely stay flat. We explain how to safely generate extra yield by selling covered calls on your Intel position."
4564891,2022-12-16,Intel: Time To Sink Or Swim,"For Intel, 2022 has become a black page amid the turnaround. Intel now needs to turn the page. Its (internal) progress in 2023 will determine whether it will sink or swim in 2024+. Intel previously failed in these final stretches of development, so the stakes are high. There are stark parallels with how AMD remained very cheap for very long, even though everyone knew it had Zen in the pipeline."
4565211,2022-12-19,Intel: This Pullback Is An Early Christmas Gift From Mr. Market - Don't Miss It,
4565671,2022-12-21,"Intel: Cheap Valuation, But Past Recession Performance Suggests Caution","I know it's not the positive outlook existing owners want to hear, but a recession will likely drag Intel's price even lower. A cheap valuation exists to support price eventually. And, the company should benefit from the long-term push to build new U.S. production capacity. Turnarounds can take time (many years), and trading momentum is still quite bearish. If interested in buying shares, I would wait for lower quotes. I rate the stock a Hold for current stakeholders."
4565911,2022-12-22,Intel: Super Play On Autonomous Driving,"Following Mobileye's IPO, we believe Intel could continue to be a key partner for Mobileye for product development and could leverage its relationship with Mobileye. We believe that Qualcomm has the performance advantage over Mobileye and its competitors as it had the highest ranking in 3 out of the 5 performance metrics compared. Despite that, we believe Mobileye has the overall full stack advantage in AV solutions with the highest number of AV capabilities over competitors."
4566444,2022-12-26,"It Is What It Is, Intel Is My Rebound Bet For 2023",This is my 141st value buy endorsement for Intel. Intel has enough agility to overcome the negativity of investors/market traders. I now appreciate Intel as an AI company. Intel still owns more than 90% of Mobileye. Mobileye’s market cap has risen $10 billion since October IPO. An ad campaign to remake Intel as an AI-first company could improve its investment quality. The 38.1% CAGR of the $93.5 AI industry is a strong tailwind. I applaud that Jon Peddie Research reported Intel has 4% market share in discrete GPUs. This is already half of AMD’s 8% share. Mercury Research’s Q3 2022 report says Intel’s overall market share in x86 processors is 71.5%. This is notably higher than Q2’s 63.5%.
4566735,2022-12-28,AMD Vs. Intel Stock: Which Is The Better Buy? Both Are Good Over Different Time Periods,AMD's share price is down more than 58% and Intel's is down more than 49% over the year. Intel has a substantial 5.6% dividend. Both companies have a bright future over the next few years.
4566708,2022-12-28,Intel Might Have Bottomed,"China remains the largest region in terms of revenue contribution to Intel, and the export control restriction poses a challenge to the company going forward. The company's cost-cutting measures should help preserve book value and put a floor on valuation. The company's PC share is stabilizing, and we might be near the trough level regarding the decline in the INTC PC market share. Intel's Internal Foundry Model should drive efficiencies and reduce costs to drive the company towards its target gross margin of ~60%. INTC is a strong long-term buy around its Book Value of $24.20 per share with a holding period of three to five years."
4566845,2022-12-29,Intel Plots Improbable Path To Zettascale,"For the first time after revealing the zettascale 2027 target in 2021 (implying 1000x in just six years), Intel has detailed the innovations that are required. As Moore’s Law will only yield around a 10x improvement, Intel envisions quite exotic new tech such as ultra-low voltage and temperature CMOS, and silicon photonics. Even if all of these innovations would be realized timely, the main issue is likely that while performance per watt may be improved sufficiently, performance per dollar may not. For example, the reason ultra-low voltage computing is uncommon is because GPU manufacturers push the voltage to improve performance per mm2 of silicon. While Intel has presented an exciting engineering challenge, there is currently no investment thesis."
4566978,2022-12-30,Intel: Cheap For A Reason - Germany Plant In Jeopardy,"With the growing inflationary pressure, elevated energy costs, and rising unemployment rates, INTC's expansion plans in Germany may be at risk, depending on the subsidy expansion. Things do not look rosy in Germany as well, with the ongoing energy crisis, massive €264B subsidy program, and high debt levels of €2.48T in 2021. With China yet to approve the deal, it is uncertain whether the Tower Semi acquisition will be successful, significantly destabilized by the ongoing Chips War. The PC destruction is also not expected to alleviate in the short term, prompting the management's swift portfolio divestiture and aggressive operating optimization. Things remain exceedingly volatile indeed, indicating the minimal margin of safety for those who choose to add here, despite the massive discount from peak levels in 2021."
4566860,2022-12-30,Cisco And Intel: Avoid One Of These High-Yield Blue-Chips,"Tech utilities are a great way for conservative income investors to enjoy generous, safe, and steadily growing yield in all economic conditions. Intel is a former tech utility that has run into endless problems as its moat has deteriorated and rivals have eaten its lunch. No one can match Intel on R&D and growth spending, but so far that hasn't turned into actual growth. In contrast, Cisco is firing on all cylinders, and delivering double-digit growth in subscription revenue which now makes up 43% of sales. Cisco is currently a more profitable, better run, lower risk, AA-rated high-yield tech utility with long-term risk management in the top 80 companies on earth according to S&P. It offers superior short and long-term return potential to Intel and is a superior choice for conservative income investors."
4569562,2023-01-12,Nvidia Vs. Intel Stock: Which Is The Better Buy For 2023?,Both Nvidia and Intel have fallen in price by over 40% in the last year. Intel's usual substantial FCF ( Free Cash Flow) has become negative $13 billion in the last year. Nvidia's revenue has fallen by more than 25% in the last two quarters.
4569512,2023-01-12,"Can Intel Stock Recover In 2023? No, Be Prepared For A Longer Wait","Intel's stock price dropped by -50% in 2022, and the company's poor share price last year is attributable to its server CPU market share loss and weak profitability. A meaningful recovery in INTC's stock price in 2023 is unlikely, in my view, but I have a positive opinion of Intel's turnaround potential in the long term. I maintain a Hold rating for Intel, as I think that INTC will take a few more years to engineer a complete turnaround."
4569934,2023-01-14,Intel: CHIPS Act Not Factored In,"The thesis of this article is simply that the benefits from the CHIPS Act are not properly factored into Intel’s current market valuation. Consensus estimate project an EPS recovery around 2025. However, market sentiment could trigger a stock price rebound ahead of EPS improvement once the benefits of the act begin to kick in. Contrasting Intel’s fab business with AMD, a fabless chip designer, further illustrates Intel’s mispricing."
4570062,2023-01-15,Intel: Sending AMD A Message With Sapphire Rapids,"Intel officially launched its Sapphire Rapid data center processors last week, aiming to mitigate potential share loss against AMD. Intel also updated its long-term PC TAM, suggesting that it still sees solid gains given secular tailwinds. INTC has outperformed the S&P 500 since its December lows, likely reflecting a better-than-expected Q4 earnings release. Will CEO Pat Geisinger & his team be able to turn things around against AMD in 2023?"
4569994,2023-01-15,Intel: The Expected Growth May Never Happen,"Intel's stock price has declined by 50% in the past 3 years, driven by product delays, the changing of the competitive landscape, management changes, and recession fears. Many investors are considering INTC's stock as one, which could provide growth at a reasonable price. However, the growth and its extent are quite uncertain in the current macroeconomic environment. We are taking a more conservative approach and are valuing INTC's stock solely based on its dividends and potential dividend growth. Other factors, like share buybacks and the impact of the CHIPS Act, are also taken into consideration. Currently, we rate INTC as hold."
4570700,2023-01-18,Intel: Our Top Pick For 2023 Is Another Undervalued Company The Market Hates,"Intel has renewed government support behind the company, which could provide it billions in capital. The company has the benefit of being able to focus on new nodes rather than ramping up capacity like other manufacturers. The company's financial picture has remained reasonably strong for a transitioning portfolio and a struggling economy. 2023 is an incredibly important year for the company, we expect things to pan out, however, whether that happens remains to be seen."
4570795,2023-01-19,Intel Is A Buy Ahead Of Intel 4 Release,"Even with Intel's 10nm fabrication, Intel's client-side business is faring well. Intel's planned 7nm launch will likely improve Intel's competitiveness. Intel's launch of Intel 4, 7nm fabrication, will likely instate confidence in investors, potentially allowing a higher valuation multiple."
4571483,2023-01-22,Intel: Q4 Earnings Will Be The Moment Of Truth,"The PC market slowed down dramatically in the fourth quarter, indicating that Intel will report weak earnings next week. The PC market down-turn accelerated in Q4'22 and it will likely result in a very disappointing FY 2023 outlook for Intel. Intel’s projected FCF loss of $2-4B in FY 2022 could have been avoided if the company decided to eliminate its dividend. Continual PC market weakness and deteriorating consumer demand could force Intel to cut its dividend in FY 2023."
4571429,2023-01-22,"It Is What It Is, Intel Is A Buy",I reiterate the buy rating I gave Intel last December 26. The Sapphire Rapids Xeon server processors tout better AI performance than AMD’s EPYC. INTC trades below $30. It still has more upside potential because its one-year performance is still -47%. My near-term price target for INTC is still $31.20. This PT could happen after Q4 F2022 numbers are reported this coming January 26. Nvidia is helping Intel sell more AI-centric Xeon server processors. Intel is needed by Nvidia to compete better against AMD. I guesstimate that Nvidia could help sell 200k units of the $17k Sapphire Rapids Xeon 8490H server processor.

4572800,2023-01-26,Intel: Complete Devastation,"Intel Corporation's horrific Q4 earnings were just released. The margin compression is eye-popping. The Intel Corporation dividend may not be safe, and the deficit cannot continue indefinitely. Controlling spending, but much more work to do."
4572796,2023-01-26,Intel: $15 Before $40,Intel Corporation reported Q4 2022 results that were far worse than our negative forecasts. Outlook has gone decisively negative. Intel Corporation dividend likely gets cut in 2023.
4572451,2023-01-26,Intel: This Is A Pivotal Moment,"Intel will report its Q4 earnings results later today after the market closes. This will become one of the most important reports in years as it has all the chances to shed light on whether Pat Gelsinger can restore Intel's former glory. As we await the results, this article explains whether now is a good time to add Intel's shares to your portfolio."

4573016,2023-01-27,We Rate Intel Stock At Accumulate Because It's Not About The Numbers,"Intel Corporation delivered about the worst quarter we've ever seen from a company we cover. We reiterate our Accumulate rating. Because we don't think it's about the numbers, we think it's about China."
4572938,2023-01-27,Intel Q4 Reflections: Still A Value Trap,"Intel's Q4 2022 performance was a bad. And the company's outlook for early 2023 is even worse. Intel's Q4 revenue and net-income fell by 32% and 114% year over year respectively. Revenues for Q1 2023 will likely fall between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion, which could be as much as $3.5 billion below Wall-Street expectations. Investors should also consider that it is not 'only the market/ macro' environment, as Intel continues to loose market share against competitors. On the backdrop of EPS contraction though 2025, I now calculate a fair implied share price for INTC equal to $23.5/share. Intel remains a 'Sell'."
4573265,2023-01-28,Intel Is Collapsing,"Two quarters after delivering a kitchen sink quarter, Intel is at it again with incredibly low Q1 guidance. Intel continued to ship markedly below PC sales due to the inventory correction. If EPS can decline by 80-90% due to the downturn, then in the upturn, it could rise again by 5-10x, or even more as the spending reductions materialize. Intel remains a solid investment opportunity based on 2025 catalysts that include renewed process and data center leadership, and emerging foundry, graphics and Mobileye businesses providing additional growth."
4573234,2023-01-28,Intel Q4: Panic Time,Intel submitted its Q4’22 earnings sheet yesterday which was a complete disaster. Intel’s outlook for Q1'23 is highly disappointing. Investors have to expect massive EPS downward revisions. Deteriorating market environment strongly implies that Intel is facing further selling pressure.
4573376,2023-01-29,Intel: Dreadful Start To 2023,"Intel has seen a tough fourth quarter in 2022. The first quarter guidance for 2023 is particularly underwhelming. The shortfall for the guidance is worrying, with few green shoots visibly seen, despite some upbeat comments by management."
4573354,2023-01-29,"Intel's Earnings Were Horrible, But The Company Is Not","Intel's earnings were shockingly poor, surpassed on by Q1 guidance. The company is bottoming out, as its execution improves in almost all aspects. IFS is an extremely important growth vector, and is showing current growth, successful execution, and enormous future engagement."
4573441,2023-01-30,Intel: Pessimism Marks Another Golden Buying Opportunity,"Intel delivered a shocking FQ1'23 guidance that left investors reeling and also caught Wall Street analysts off guard. Will Intel be able to mount a comeback against both AMD and TSMC? So far, the company has yet to prove its ability to execute that strategy. With macro headwinds intensifying, investors must consider the significant execution risks in its valuation. The crucial question persists: Can investors have confidence in CEO Pat Gelsinger's ability to execute and improve INTC's current valuation?"
4574058,2023-01-31,An Update On The Intel-Tower Deal And Organic Growth Of Foundry Businesses,"Eleven months after the deal for Intel to acquire Tower was announced, an important regulatory hurdle remains to be overcome, namely in China. In this case, despite all the geopolitical tensions and semiconductor-related sanctions, there is a glimmer of hope. For this matter, I base myself on differentiated products which are needed by China as the world's largest semis market and which do not necessarily compete with the more commoditized products manufactured there. Still, in the worst-case scenario that the deal does not go through, both companies can rely on organic revenue growth to make progress in their foundry services. Adopting a cautionary stance due to grim industry-level forecasts for 2023, I have Hold positions for both stocks despite being undervalued with respect to the sector."
4573788,2023-01-31,Intel's Bumpy Ride To Glory Just Got Bumpier,"For Q4 2022, Intel's results were nightmarish: big misses on revenue and EPS accompanied by extremely poor guidance for Q1 2023. Consequently, Intel shares tanked ~6.5% on Friday. In this article, I will share my analysis of Intel's Q4 and provide an updated valuation for the company. Furthermore, we will review Intel's technical chart and quant factor grades to make an informed investment decision. I rate Intel a modest """"Buy"""" at $28."
4573781,2023-01-31,Intel's Q4: Delusion And Intervention,"Intel's disastrous string of earnings suggests deep, fundamental problems. The company's strategy and leadership appears to be increasingly out of touch with reality, deepening our concerns. Accountability and intervention is needed to truly turn the company around."

The stock dropped 11% after its latest quarterly report, while it also achieved partially recovering its intraday losses. In this technical article, I show important price levels and metrics that investors could consider for gaining an edge on the stock’s likely price action. By considering multiple outcomes and setting up an adequate contingency plan, investors are less inclined to act driven by emotions, as this could come at a higher cost. While I continue to rank INTC as a long-term hold position, I also discuss a very interesting short-term trading opportunity."

4575680,2023-02-06,Why We Think Intel Will Cut Its Dividend,Intel Corporation's management provided no business guidance for 2023. Capital expenditures will be larger than ever in the coming year. Negative free cash flow and the use of commercial paper are cause for speculation about Intel's need for cash.
4575574,2023-02-06,Intel: Dividend Faces Major Risk,"Intel slashed employee pay in a desperate sign the company has cash flow problems. Management appears committed to the dividend, yet the $6 billion in annual pay-outs are problematic for a business under pressure. The stock faces more downside pressure on a cut or even elimination of the dividend."
4575530,2023-02-06,Intel: A Dividend Cut Looms,Q4's free cash flow improved a little but the dividend still seems in danger. Consider selling cash-secured puts at a strike price you like. I explain why $20 is an interesting entry point.

The key dividing issue between bears and bulls is whether his turnaround plan will work (or is working) or not. This article provides my independent and data-driven evaluation. And I will conclude that Gelsinger’s Intel Corporation management team has been effective in executing the plan."
4576332,2023-02-08,Intel: Keeping The Costly Dividend,Intel announced an $11 billion bond offering this week. Fresh capital should get the company through 2023. Additional short-term expense should keep payout steady.
4576708,2023-02-09,Intel: Further Downside Is Likely (Technical Analysis),"The annual revenue for Intel was $63.05 billion in 2022 as compared to $79.02 billion in 2021. The share price of Intel has emerged bearish pennant indicating further downside. INTC stock is likely to experience bearish pressure; however, $20 is a significant level to accumulate long-term positions."
4576078,2023-02-10,Intel: Dividend Growth May Be Minimal - Talent Loss Remains A Concern,
4577258,2023-02-10,"Intel: Tough Road Ahead, But Stock Has Not Made A New Low","Intel's annual capex nut is still the long-term problem. The dividend could get eliminated, but Intel's senior unsecured credit rating by S&P / Moody's is still A-/A3. The dividend won't likely survive a credit downgrade to BBB. Intel's added 20,000 jobs since June '21. Expense management counts as much as capex management. In terms of the potential to recover, the PC biz is still roughly 50% of Intel's revenue and 60% - 70% of operating income. It's suffering from the post-Covid hangover. Continued recovery in free cash flow is a must."
4577829,2023-02-13,Intel: Short Term Pain For Long Term Gains,"We remain bullish on Intel even after a grim 1Q23 outlook. We expect the worst of the macroeconomic headwinds and inventory correction in the PC Client and the data center markets to have been fully factored into the stock. We believe the PC market’s retreat from the pandemic boom levels has pressured Intel significantly; we are more constructive on the PC Client inventory correction cycle ending in 1H23. On the data center front, while we expect softer cloud spending in 2023, we believe Intel’s new """"Sapphire Rapid"""" server CPU is well-positioned to stamp share loss to AMD. While the stock price could remain volatile in 1H23, we continue to believe Intel provides a favorable risk-reward for longer-term investors as it works to become a meaningful foundry player."

Under a comparative contextual analysis, TSM is superior, but both stocks are in the middle of a cyclical downturn correction. Intel remains miles away from its potential, leading to its undervaluation. Still, from a macro perspective, Intel possesses a vital function in the semiconductor sphere that faces challenges, but its turnaround path gets more apparent. This year's industry-wide sales decline is expected to be 6.5%, with the chip oversupply expected to normalize in 2024. However, the industry is cyclical and remains on sale, expected to rebound between 2H-2023 and 2024."

Intel has had a terrible decade in which it faced many technical challenges, resulting in it falling behind the competition. While the recently released financials were once again horrible (as was the outlook), Intel does look like its on schedule regarding its product releases and technological progress. While the thesis is overly negative, government incentives and new node releases are positives for Intel. The company also still holds a significant position in the PC x86 CPU market. In my eyes, the future remains highly uncertain. There seems to be a lot depending on the success of the ambitious turnaround resulting in significant operational risks, making it a risky investment."
4579935,2023-02-20,"Intel: Dividends At Risk, But It Doesn't Matter For The Long-Term","Intel’s catastrophic performance in Q4 and a weak outlook for Q1 indicate that it would be hard for the business to become FCF-neutral in 2023. As a result, there’s a risk that the management would be required to cut the dividends at the end of the year to decrease the cash burn rate. However, Intel’s stock could be a solid investment for long-term investors due to the company’s potential to access a significant pool of public funds to decrease the costs of turnaround."
4580824,2023-02-22,Intel: A Potential 'Kitchen Sink' Moment,"Tech giant Intel announced a huge cut to its healthy quarterly dividend pay-outs today. Shares of this semiconductor manufacturer had already lost nearly half of their value in 2022 as the company attempted to make inroads in the foundry business. The company's initial forecasts for FY22 and FY23 against actual results and current forecasts were embarrassingly bad, with management’s read on market dynamics head scratching. Prior to the dividend announcement this morning, the stock was finding technical support in the mid-20s despite almost universal bearish Wall Street sentiment. Where do the shares go from here?  An investment analysis follows in the paragraphs below."
4580671,2023-02-22,Intel Drops The Dividend Bombshell,"Intel Corporation cut its dividend by two-thirds. The writing was on the wall due to Intel's cash flow problems. Intel could be a turnaround play, but it is not certain that things will work out well."
4580631,2023-02-22,Intel Drops The Hammer,
4580624,2023-02-22,Intel: The Dividend Cut Does Not Change The Stock Trajectory,"We called for the dividend cut in June 2022. The forecast was based on Intel's ballooning inventories and poor prospects for profits for the next two years. The cut was about in line with our expectations, but Intel still looks destined for the teens."
4581267,2023-02-23,Intel: What Happens Now?,"Intel has cut its dividend by two-thirds, a move which does not surprise me at all. In fact, such a move should perhaps have been announced earlier. Dividend investors do not like the move, creating a potential opportunity. With valuations down and the Mobileye stake getting more valuable, these could be interesting levels, albeit that conviction is lacking."
4581068,2023-02-23,Intel: Resetting Dividend Expectations To Take On TSMC,"Intel slashed its dividends by nearly 66%. Are you surprised? You shouldn't be. Before the cut, Intel was expected to post a negative free cash flow of nearly $8B in FY23. As such, the original $6B in annualized dividend payout has been reduced closer to the $2B mark. Therefore, it has given Intel much better flexibility in investing further to bolster its ability to catch up with TSMC."
4581818,2023-02-24,"Intel: The Dividend Should Have Been Cut Completely, Remains A Value Trap","Intel has reported very poor results, and its guidance for Q1 2023 was quite negative.

As Pat Gelsinger had promised, without delays, it would have been a leadership product, obliterating AMD’s… last-gen Epyc Milan. AMD’s recent Genoa still reigns supreme. For Intel investors, this CPU is a stepping stone and proof point for what Intel could accomplish without process and design issues. Intel remains on track to the 2024-2025 turnaround. Intel finally announces dividend reduction. It is one of the many actions Intel has done to respond to the near-term demand environment. The technology progress remains on track."

4583462,2023-03-04,Sell Intel And Buy These World-Beater Dividend Blue Chips,"Intel Corporation just slashed its dividend by 66%. It was the first dividend cut since the company began paying one 31 years ago. Studies show that dividend cutters historically underperform and have higher volatility to boot. When the dividend is cut, it's time to sell. Intel just confirmed its fundamentals are the worst in at least 31 years. Intel's new lower dividend will cost it $6.3 billion over the next three years and require $12 billion in new debt. Its interest costs will soar by 140%. If we get into a recession, Intel could suspend the dividend entirely. Intel offers 7.7% long-term return potential, while these 2 rivals are thriving hyper-growth chip stocks with excellent management, wide moats, and efficient R&D. They offer 19% to 26% long-term return potential, 2.5X to 3.5X more than Intel."

Intel has now announced a new major delay, this time regarding its much-anticipated Falcon Shores GPU/XPU, which seems to be delayed (partly) to 2026. To be sure, Intel should remain competitive, as Ponte Vecchio is competitive with Hopper and a GPU-only Falcon Shores on 20/18A may outclass anything on N3 Nvidia might launch. Intel announced at investor meeting the goal of approaching $10B in AXG (accelerated computing and graphics) revenue by 2026. Given the lackluster ongoing execution, this seems ever more unlikely."
4584756,2023-03-06,We Predicted Intel's Dividend Cut: Here's What We Think Comes Next,"Despite the dividend cut, Intel's EV/EBITDA valuation remains above historical levels.

However, the semiconductor industry is not done with growing and Intel should be back for the next upward cycle. INTC stock is trading close to an all-time low in price-to-sales ratio, while owning 26% of their market cap in cash and short-term investments. Mobileye, of which Intel is still a majority shareholder by 94%, is worth almost 1/3 of the parent company after a massive run. Yet, Investors should watch out for Intel's sly accounting and visual presentation tricks."
4585953,2023-03-09,Intel: It's Years Too Soon To Call It A Buy,"Intel Corporation's competitive position has been slowly degrading for many years, and its financial position is beginning to follow suit. In response, Intel has rolled out an ambitious roadmap to reverse its decline and reclaim its dominant position. I am skeptical of Intel's odds of success, and I have some concerns regarding the company's plans. Regardless, since we are in such an early stage of the revamp and the company could still rise or fall on these plans, I recommend holding for now."
4586565,2023-03-10,Intel: No Levers Left To Pull,
4588172,2023-03-17,Intel: Losing R&D Leadership,"Intel’s R&D budget had increased to $17.5 billion in 2022 which is 27.8% of its revenue. Both AMD and TSMC are also increasing their R&D expenses to launch new products and these two rivals cumulatively spent over $10 billion on R&D in 2022. Due to the higher revenue growth rate in AMD and TSMC, we should see a faster increase in their R&D budget. It is highly likely that the cumulative R&D budget of AMD and TSMC will outpace Intel in 2024 which will cause further erosion of the competitive edge for Intel. Intel is already lagging behind AMD in the product cycle due to past delays and any loss in the R&D race will end up hurting the long-term growth trajectory for the company."
4589063,2023-03-21,Intel: Buying At The Point Of Maximum Pessimism,"In the middle of a cyclical downturn, it's always darkest before dawn, and we might have reached the optimum pessimism levels for Intel. The cost reduction efforts to prove effective over the long run support the company in achieving its master plan to regain its leadership or at least catch up with the competition. Moreover, the stock has shown strong support levels slightly above its book value per share of $24.50, signaling a bottom. I'm staying invested in INTC, with a possible exit in the next cyclical uptrend around 2025-2026."

Intel announced a reduction in its quarterly dividend by about two thirds due to weak PC demand, competition from AMD, and ongoing execution issues leading to market share loss. Valuation analysis suggests the stock is significantly undervalued, but I prefer to stay on the sidelines."
4591319,2023-03-30,Intel: Market Share Donor,"Intel Corporation provided a positive update on Data Center and AI chips. The chip giant will likely continue to donate market share to peers, even if it gets new chips like Emerald Rapids, Sierra Forest, and Granite Rapids to market on time. Intel Corporation stock remains expensive at 17x '24 EPS targets that are shrouded by risk of more chip delays crushing these forecasts."
4591209,2023-03-30,Intel: Positive Takeaways From Recent AI Investor Presentation (Rating Upgrade),"Intel highlighted its expectations of a larger and faster-growing TAM for its data center and AI business at a recent investor event. INTC's prior takeover of Habana Labs in 2019 has put the company in a good position now to compete in the AI inference market with Gaudi chips developed by Habana. I upgrade my rating for Intel to a Buy, taking into account the positive takeaways from the company's recent investor conference relating to its 2027 TAM and AI inference opportunities."
4591458,2023-03-31,Intel's Data Center And AI Strategy: Opportunity Amidst Financial Challenges,"Intel projects low 20s% TAM growth through 2027, with AI inference being a significant growth area, but faces strong competition from incumbents like Nvidia. Intel's support for SYCL and its ambitious server CPU roadmap signal positive developments, but execution risks and market challenges remain. The company's data center and AI efforts show potential, but Intel must overcome financial challenges and competitive pressures to capitalize on the opportunities."
4591455,2023-03-31,Intel DCAI Business Update Leads To Premature Optimism,"Intel DCAI Business Update meeting caused a strong runup in the stock, but a keen evaluation shows the optimism is premature. The roadmap presented does not catch up to the competition until 2025 even if the execution is flawless. Intel's roadmap success is more likely to depend on the chips Intel tapes out to TSMC than the chips Intel fabricates in-house."
4591798,2023-04-02,Intel: Buyers Strike Back,"Investors who bet against Intel were stunned by INTC's recent relative strength, outperforming the S&P 500 and the iShares Semiconductor ETF. In February, the company's decision to slash dividends was a game-changer, triggering an exodus of income investors at its March lows. Intel unveiled strategies to compete against AMD and Nvidia in the AI logic market. However, Intel's execution will likely be the focus. With INTC's valuation normalized, the buying opportunity is less compelling. Accordingly, income investors who want to bail out should consider selling its recent strength."
4591845,2023-04-03,2023 Top Pick Review: Intel Remains Undervalued,"Intel was a risky decision for a top investment; however, we felt the company had crossed the line into being substantially undervalued. The company has strong """"home field"""" support as the most technologically advanced U.S. foundry/chip producer. The company remains on track for its goals of N4/N3 production, but the ramp and final sales to customers will be the telling step. At the end of the day, financials are what makes an investment, so we expect, over the next few years, Intel will improve its business and generate stronger shareholder returns."
4592234,2023-04-04,"Intel Xeon: One Step Forward, Two Steps Backwards","Intel’s recent data center webinar was well received by investors, as the stock rallied upwards. My own analysis of the event is more sceptical. While Intel moved one step forward with 18A Clearwater Forest in 2025 (an unquestioned leadership product), it also moved two steps backwards. Previously rumored to feature 334 or even 512 cores, these higher core count Sierra Forest-AP parts have been canceled in favor of the unambitious 144-core Sierra Forest-SP. Diamond Rapids, the 18A P-core counterpart of Clearwater Forest, once scheduled for 2024, is now missing in the 2025 roadmap, implying a delay to 2026. Despite these additional Xeon setbacks, investors may remain bullish given (1) the process roadmap remaining on track, (2) the low valuation/stock price, and (3) the three emerging businesses."

4592724,2023-04-06,Intel: Stock Oversold On Market Headwinds,"Intel Corporation has built on its competitiveness in laptop CPUs, with its performance benchmark scores overtaking AMD for the first time. We believe its strong performance improvement is responsible for Intel’s laptop market share gain for the first time in the past 5 years. For desktop CPUs, Intel has maintained superior value in terms of performance per pricing against AMD, as it has maintained its CPU prices consistently lower than AMD. For server CPUs, Intel is disadvantaged against AMD, which has superior value in terms of performance per pricing, as its performance is almost double of Intel. Despite weakness in the PC market expected to continue in 2023, we believe the company."
4593225,2023-04-10,Intel: A Chance At Redemption,"Intel is looking to report a quarterly revenue bottom. Free cash flow needs to turn higher for the dividend to rebound. Short interest hit 52-week highs, albeit at a low percentage."
4593469,2023-04-11,Intel: Brace For More Pain After IDC Report,"A recent IDC report highlighted that conditions in the PC market have not improved in Q1 2023. As a result, Intel Corporation is likely going to report weak Q1 2023 earnings later this month. The EPS revision trend is already very negative. Investors must expect Intel to fully suspend its dividend in FY 2023 if conditions in the PC market don’t improve."
4593824,2023-04-13,Intel's Turnaround Effort Nearing Fruition In H2 2023,"Intel continues to confirm that the company is on track for not only Intel 4 but an entire future line-up through 2025. Intel's continued progress could see an unexpected benefit as its key competitor were experiencing delays. With industry headwinds expected to ease, the overall environment is shaping up to be a favorable one for Intel in the latter half of 2023."
4594142,2023-04-15,Here's Why Intel May Still Remain The Market Leader,"In the recent Data Center/ AI Conference, INTC presented its game plan in retaining the lion's share in the CPU market, significantly aided by the partnership with MSFT and NVDA. Combined with Gaudi 3 and Sierra Forest Xeon to be launched by 2024, INTC may just claim a decent market share in the generative AI market moving forward. Given the excellent support the stock had enjoyed thus far, investors may consider adding INTC at the next retracement to mid-$20s for an improved margin of safety. Nonetheless, despite being INTC investors ourselves, we prefer to adopt a wait-and-see attitude due to the intense competition offered by its peers such as AMD/ NVDA/ ARM/ GOOG/ AMZN."
4597511,2023-04-27,Intel: Q1 Results Show Some Progress,Intel reports top and bottom line beats for Q1. Q2 guidance was a bit mixed. Cash flow picture needs to improve quickly.
4597523,2023-04-27,Intel: Spending Itself Into A Hole,"Intel Corporation reported Q1 2023 results that were better than feared, but the company burned a ton of cash during the March quarter. The chip giant saw net debt soar during the quarter due the loss, large capex spending and the payment of the last large dividend. Intel Corporation stock is expensive at $30 with debt soaring, and with the best expectations for an EPS to top $2 not until 2025 at the earliest."
4597494,2023-04-27,Intel Q1 2023 Earnings: Brace For More Turbulence Ahead,"Intel Corporation reported better-than-expected Q1 results along with a guide for modest improvements in the current quarter that beat estimates. However, expectations for continued double-digit declines at Intel, paired with continued cautious industry commentary over the near-term semiconductor demand environment, are dampening earlier optimism for a 2H recovery. There remains insufficient structural evidence supportive of respite for Intel's fundamental struggles over the near term."
4597828,2023-04-28,Intel Corporation: Walking Dead (Rating Downgrade),"Intel Corporation stock has rallied a bit, perhaps on the news that we may be near the bottom of the cycle. This was the biggest loss in company history, and there is growing concern that this company is dying relative to competitors, fears that are overblown in our view. Intel stock is likely to be a bit of a zombie the next few months until there is clarity that a turnaround is clearly going well. But the one thing that drew investors to Intel for years, the dividend, is a long way from being restored, and as such as a no-growth stock, Intel should continue to be a zombie."
4597753,2023-04-28,"Intel Q1 Earnings: Darkest Before Dawn Or Pitch-Black, You Decide","Expectations ahead of the Intel Corporation Q1 earnings were so low that it was almost impossible for the company to miss meeting them.

4598363,2023-04-30,Intel: We Have Not Seen The Bottom Yet,Intel suffered its worst-ever quarterly loss in the first quarter. Moderating growth in the PC market continues to have an outsized influence on Intel’s consumer-facing CCG group. The Data Center/AI business now also experiences a dramatic downturn. Intel's valuation and risk profile remain unattractive to investors.
4598455,2023-05-01,Intel: 3 Things The Wall Street Cheerleaders Are Getting Wrong,"There is always a bottom for Wall Street, and the """"buy the dip"""" mentality remains intact. Intel rose sharply as Wall Street """"hoped"""" the worst was behind. Near-term, they may be right, but longer-term they are dead wrong."
4598571,2023-05-01,Intel: Expect More Damage,"Intel remains on track to launch and ship its Clearwater Forest data center CPU by 2025. In addition, management is confident in process leadership with Intel 18A. However, it remains to be seen whether Intel could overcome AMD's challenges with its Sapphire Rapids processor. Management's commentary suggests further near-term share losses. INTC has recovered remarkably from its December 2022 and March 2023 lows. Sellers aptly rejected recent buyers in early April. While INTC's valuation is not aggressive, its execution risks and weak growth factors could hamper further upward momentum from here."
4598556,2023-05-01,Intel: Mega Turnaround Starts Now,"With hugely declining revenue/profitability/cash flow and a mediocre product portfolio, Intel is an easy target for mockery. However, in less than just two years, Intel will be completely unrecognizable. As case in point, together with regaining process leadership, gross margin is also expected to recover to 60% by 2026, up from 33% (GAAP) or 38% (non-GAAP) currently. Hence, the people who are betting against Intel are only looking at the (recent) past or the present at best. The future lies wide open as the turnaround starts now. Intel announced two significant milestones with Meteor Lake (Intel 4) now in production and confirming that 18A will also achieve cost (transistor density) leadership."
4598532,2023-05-01,"Intel Q1: Margins Woes, But Can China Save The Day?",Intel Corporation's declining gross margins and persistent concerns about end-demand and competition raise red flags for investors. A recovering China could provide pricing tailwinds that may help alleviate Intel's gross margin issues. Valuing Intel remains challenging due to its deteriorating financial metrics and uncertainty surrounding its competitive strength and future earnings.
4599027,2023-05-02,Intel Corporation: Watch The Balance Sheet,"Intel Corporation's first quarter results were a bit stronger than feared. The Intel second quarter outlook suggests that real stabilization is seen in the business. This is very much welcomed as free cash flows are hugely negative. Stronger commercial traction, even at lower levels, is offset by Intel Corporation's balance sheet deterioration, making me a bit cautious after a recent run-up in the shares."
4598908,2023-05-02,"Intel: Still Unique, Still A Buy","Intel is a unique semiconductor company due to its extensive ownership of fabrication facilities, something which could become increasingly important in the near future.

The company was forced to cut its dividend, however, it remains mostly on track for its capacity ramp-up. Capital spending will be tens of billions of dollars. Intel has massive homegrown support for its business, with tax incentives etc., which should enable strong support for its future business."
4602431,2023-05-10,Intel: Bottom Could Be In,"Intel once again reported horrible first quarter results with declining revenues and a bottom line loss. Despite short-term challenges - including a recession on the horizon - I believe in Intel as long-term investment. Not only will the underlying market grow with a high pace, but I also assume Intel's investments in its foundry service will pay off in the years to come. And returning to previous free cash flow levels is more than enough to make Intel a bargain at this point."
4604333,2023-05-14,Intel: Learning To Walk Again,"For the first time since many quarters, Intel delivered a better than expected earnings report; but to be fair, estimates have provided a very low bar to top. Going into Q2, management sees tailwinds from an improving demand backdrop, and suggests that group revenue might have bottomed in Q1. Accordingly, with Intel's fundamentals starting to improve slightly, I am cautiously raising my EPS targets through 2023. I continue to assign a 'Hold/ equal weight' rating on the backdrop of persisting competitive challenges."

Intel is implementing aggressive cost-saving measures to address the deterioration of its financial results. They reduced their dividend and are lobbying for government subsidies to cover their CapEx. AMD's forthcoming MI300 data center APUs are expected to compete with NVIDIA's offerings. AMD also expects a recovery in the second half of the year, with growth in Data Center revenue due to a new product line and improvements in the PC market. The semiconductor sector remains highly cyclical, and even though predicting the next uptrend is challenging, there are reasonable grounds to expect the uptrend to start in the year's second half and surge in 2024."

While we believe our investment thesis regarding moderating CPU share loss to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and potential foundry growth remains in play, we expect the A.I. boom to hurt CPU sales. A.I. applications require much more parallel computing power, necessitating more GPUs; hence, the most advanced systems will require a higher ratio of GPUs to CPUs. In the near to medium term, we also don’t expect Intel Corporation’s lineup of xPU or GPU to be able to compete meaningfully with NVDA’s GPU for A.I. applications.

4661569,2024-01-08,Intel: Time For A Sanity Check (Downgrade),"Intel Corporation stock has experienced a significant recovery, outperforming its semiconductor peers since it bottomed out in May 2023. Interestingly, Intel outperformed while it has yet to regain process leadership, displace Nvidia as the GPU leader, nor stem AMD's market share advances. While Intel's industry outlook has improved, it didn't look like the case in May or June 2023. So why did INTC bottom then? I had already presented that INTC reached peak pessimism as dip-buyers quietly accumulated. The market likely didn't want to show its hand so early, allowing momentum buyers to chase. As a result, INTC is another potent reminder that stocks bottom out when you least expect it. If you want to know how to assess it, make studying price action/investor psychology a core tenet in your analysis."

4665668,2024-01-29,Intel Offers An Unexpected Kitchen Sink Guidance,"INTC's embedded growth premium offers a minimal margin of safety, with the underwhelming forward guidance bringing forth the sobering correction in its stock prices after the recent earnings call. Its underwhelming sales in the Data Center/AI and Network/Edge segments suggest it is failing to capitalize on the generative AI boom dominated by NVDA as well. While INTC's management continues to tout advanced node test production from early 2024 onwards, the rebranded 20A and 18A nodes are only equivalent to TSM's 5nm and 3nm technologies, respectively. Thanks to the drastic price cuts and eroding x86 market share by Q4'23, the consensus are also less optimistic about its future prospects, with impacted EBIT margins through 2026. With INTC's growth story stalled and dividend investment thesis at forward yields of 1.01% underwhelming, investors looking to hop on the Made-In-USA semiconductor train may be disappointed indeed."
4666202,2024-01-30,Intel: Crash Is A Buying Opportunity,"Intel's stock had its worst day since the beginning of the pandemic after issuing a weak forecast for Q1-24. The market is underestimating Intel's performance, as Mobileye and Intel Foundry Services had record sales in 2023.

Intel's technological turnaround remains on track, but the financial reset will take longer to digest, potentially leading to a stock correction towards previous lows, opportune for long-term investors. A revenue walk from 2020-23 further confirms that, with well over $10B in exited businesses combined with the revenue decrease after the COVID-19 surge, expecting anything approaching $65-$70B revenue is highly unrealistic in the near-term. Besides the process roadmap, the main product that could drive an inflection in 2024 is Gaudi3, but progress remains behind with a sub-$3B total pipeline, nearly 10x behind Nvidia's quarterly revenue."

The internal foundry model exposes the manufacturing group as the main cause of Intel's deteriorating margins, which the turnaround will reverse. The product groups remain profitable. The turnaround could be likened to AMD's, with the 2017 Zen launch only marking the beginning of a new era of long-term growth and investor returns. Restoring tech leadership is only a prerequisite for investors. Overall, the webinar provided a strong case for returning the manufacturing side to profitability (and beyond), solidifying the case for a long-term investment."

Intel management unveiled a revised financial reporting framework for its foundry and products business to provide more clarity and instill discipline. Intel's foundry business recorded a segment loss of $7B in 2023, but management is confident in achieving breakeven profitability before 2030. I explain why Intel's fundamentally strong business model should underpin Intel Foundry's ramp cadence. With Intel pulling back closer to the key $40 support level, Intel investors should consider aggressively buying the dip."
4682162,2024-04-04,Intel: Buy The 8%+ Dip,"Intel stock fell over 8% due to the updated disclosure about its foundry business. The dip reflects near-term market reaction and presents a buying opportunity for investors who have an investing timeframe of 3-5 years. Analysts expect EPS to grow at a CAGR of 20%+ in the next few years. I see such a growth curve as very plausible thanks to a range of catalysts. The top ones are the recent $8.5B cash grant from the Biden administration, secular demand for semiconductors, and margin expansion potential."
4682384,2024-04-06,Intel: This Pullback Is Well Deserved - Foundry Ambitions Remain Too Aggressive,"INTC reports underwhelming Foundry prospects after the release of its new segment reporting, as the IDM 2.0 brings forth uncertain cash burn and drag on its overall profitability. It remains to be seen when the foundry segment will be able to deliver the critical combination of node advancement, volume manufacturing, and profitability. Given the delay in its product launches, we believe that INTC's """"five new nodes in four years"""" may be loosely termed with volume manufacturing likely to occur later. We may see its balance sheet further deteriorate from those reported in FQ4'23, with the management seemingly financing its dividend payouts with debt. Combined with the premium FWD P/E valuation and the potential volatility, INTC is not a Buy at this dip."
4682581,2024-04-07,Intel's Turnaround Is A Long Shot That May Not Pan Out,"Intel has released an updated corporate structure and roadmap, aiming to become the second-largest foundry by capacity by 2030. The company plans to segment its Intel Foundry operations into a separate legal entity to attract third-party customers. I believe this may be a bigger challenge than management anticipates. Intel will need to prove its ability to meet deadlines with the release and ramp-up of 18A."
4682541,2024-04-07,Intel: No Reason To Be Here,"Intel's Foundry business reported a massive $7.0 billion loss and a negative 37% operating margin, raising concerns about the company's pursuit of the foundry business. Intel's external revenues from the foundry business are currently low, with a goal of only reaching $15 billion annually by 2030, far below TSMC levels. The stock is likely to retest the recent $32 lows after a typical Q1 beat followed by weak guidance for the next quarter."
4682739,2024-04-08,Understanding Intel's Foundry Situation,"Intel Corporation stated they lost $7B on their foundries in 2023, and 2024 will be worse. This was not unexpected, as entering the external foundry business is very expensive, and takes time to generate profits. It was also necessary. Although things will improve after 2024, it will be several years before the foundry is a strong contributor to earnings. The potential benefit to Intel is enormous, and justifies the cost, long term."

Moreover, its excellent fundamental backdrop makes Intel a solid long-term investment opportunity. Intel's AI potential is underestimated, and the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the expanding AI boom. Intel remains a global leader in CPUs, GPUs, and other advanced chip technologies, with vast potential in the enterprise segment and AI."
4685574,2024-04-24,Intel: No Good Reason To Turn Bullish Ahead Of Q1 Earnings,"Intel is scheduled to release its earnings tomorrow, April 25. The release will be the company's first to separate the foundry business from the design business. Currently, INTC lacks TSMC's edge in courting certain customers, such as chip designers that are in competition with Intel's product design business. Intel's foundry growth has been decelerating in recent quarters. On the bright side, the non-foundry segments have swung from declines to positive growth. Intel is no longer the """"deep value name"""" it once was, for this reason, combined with limited foundry potential, I just think of it as a hold."
4686435,2024-04-25,Intel's Q1 2024 Results Magnify Further Woes Ahead,"The Intel stock has lost over a quarter of its value this year, making it one of the worst-performing stocks in the semiconductor index. Intel's valuation divergence from peers continue to reflect increasing execution risks given rising company-specific woes, spanning extended Foundry losses, limited data center AI processor share gains, and an elevated China exposure. Taken together, the Intel stock continues to face a wide-ranging plate of downside risks with limited room for near-term respite."
4687018,2024-04-27,Intel: Half A Billion Of Gaudi 3's Revenue In 2H FY24 Is Not Amazing,"Intel's Q1 FY24 results show weak growth in Mobileye and FPGA businesses, with a disappointing 5% growth in Data Center and AI business.

4687171,2024-04-29,Intel: The AI Pie In The Sky,"Intel's Q1-2024 earnings disappointed Wall Street, with guidance for revenues and margins coming in low. Analysts downgraded Intel's stock, and even the watered-down earnings look unrealistic. We examine the numbers and tell you why we were tempted to upgrade this, but ultimately stuck with a Sell."
4687581,2024-04-30,Intel On Sale As Turnaround Unfolds,"Intel reported in-line Q1 results and just below in-line guidance, with decent performance in core businesses but weakness in adjacent businesses. The company remains in the investment phase of its turnaround, with important successful milestones passed during the quarter. Intel is finally back (for real), which is clearly underappreciated. Intel's upcoming product roadmap, including Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, shows promise and indicates the company's return to competitiveness. 18A launch in mid-2025 is ahead of expectations. The valuation only reflects the near-term, whereas Intel is currently like a start-up in leading-edge manufacturing. Profitability is completely subordinate to technology progress (and the financial opportunity that will open). A comparison to Tesla shows that Intel has a much improved say/do ratio. Some companies are just talking without executing. Intel (with Pat Gelsinger) is doing both."
4687415,2024-04-30,Intel Q1 Earnings Were More Good Than Bad,"Intel's Q1 earnings report led to a drop in stock price, primarily due to soft Q2 guidance, but the impact is relatively small. Intel's dependence on revenue from China poses a significant risk due to deteriorating Chinese-American relations and China's efforts to become less dependent on external technology. The changing nature of the server market, with cloud providers making their own processors, adds to Intel's challenges, but recent product improvements offer some hope."
4688777,2024-05-02,Intel: Analyzing The Challenge Of Meeting Its Five Nodes In Four-Year Plan,"Intel's shares fell 9% after reporting mixed Q1 results and providing a weaker-than-expected outlook for the coming quarter. Intel purchased its first EUV lithography system in 2017 for <7nm nodes, but didn't decide to use them until recently. The company's poor planning and execution in adopting EUV lithography technology initially put it seven years behind its competitors. To date, however, Intel's ambitious goal of """"five nodes in four years"""" is on tracK. Intel's AI chip output is dismal compared to competitors like AMD and Nvidia, raising concerns about its competitiveness in the market."
4688491,2024-05-02,Intel: Underwhelming Q1 Results Lead To Cloudy Prospects,"Intel Corporation stock has declined by over 40% and is severely oversold, making it a potential buy opportunity. However, Intel's earnings have underwhelmed and its management's performance is a major concern. Analysts have mixed feelings about Intel's future, suggesting it is a risky investment even at current levels. Intel must improve performance before losing more lucrative market share in enterprise business, AI, and other segments."
4689756,2024-05-06,Intel: The Market Is Too Bearish,"Intel Corporation's first-quarter earnings showed decent growth in the Client Computing Group. Intel beat EPS estimates for the first fiscal quarter and the margin trend looks good. The estimated return to positive growth in device shipments in FY 2024 is positive for Intel, as the Client Computing Group continues to dominate the company's revenue mix. New product launches could be a catalyst for EPS upside revisions. The valuation is very appealing, with Intel now trading at about half its 3-year average P/E."
4690098,2024-05-07,"Intel: Could Become A Serious Player In AI And Foundry, But It'll Take A Miracle","Intel Corporation's performance has shown slight improvements, but it is still behind its best years and the turnaround will take time. The company's growth in AI and data centers is slower than expected, with competition from Nvidia and AMD. Intel's valuation has not changed much, with an intrinsic value of around $20 per share."
4690013,2024-05-07,Intel's Strategic Pivot: Unveiling Investment Opportunities,"Intel's Q1 earnings beat expectations with $12.7 billion in revenue, but fell short of revenue guidance, causing a drop in stock price, which present a great buying opportunity. Intel's upcoming products could be a catalyst for further revenue growth. Intel Foundry presents a growth story for Intel moving forward. Intel's recent strategic pivot takes advantage of the AI Growth. With its current price of 30$ per share, you are essentially buying the Intel Foundry, NEX, Mobileye, Altera and future for free."

4695946,2024-05-28,"Intel: After A Series Of Failures, This Might Be The Turning Point","Potential drivers for Intel to improve its position include positive trends in PC shipments and global capital expenditures in the data center segment. If Intel's 18A chip gains market appreciation and the company can ramp up mass production before the release of TSMC's 2 nm chip, Intel's market share could expand. We expect the company’s revenue to total $56 bln (+3% y/y) in 2024, and jump to $65.3 bln (+17% y/y) in 2025. INTC’s adjusted EBITDA is set to total $13.8 bln (+7% y/y) in 2024, and rocket to $20.3 bln (+47% y/y). We believe the company is trading well below fair value. The rating is BUY."
4697217,2024-06-03,Intel's Goldman Sach's Meeting Yields Interesting Information,"Intel's upcoming 18A process is cost-effective and more efficient than Intel 7, which will significantly improve the company's competitive position. Intel's AI products do not look compelling in the short term. Intel continues to execute well on their products, something that had been problematic before Pat Gelsinger took over. Intel's financial turnaround is still not imminent, and there will still be short term issues before the company's bets pay off."
4697202,2024-06-03,Intel: Capitalize On The Downtrend,"Intel stock has dropped 47% over the last three years, presenting a good entry point for long-term investors. Following a 29% pullback, the convergence of technical indicators suggests a strategic opportunity to establish or intensify long positions using DCA, with $31 to $25 being the ideal entry range. Intel's financial performance has been dismal since 2020, with significant revenue, profitability, and EPS declines driven by the end of its Apple partnership, increased competition, and geopolitical headwinds. Despite financial struggles, Intel's focus on AI innovation and internal foundry technology aims to unlock $10 billion in savings by 2025, positioning the company for a strong recovery and growth in the AI chip market."

4697466,2024-06-05,Intel: Poised For A Recovery (Upgrade),"Intel's stock price has dropped 30% despite strong business performance, presenting a buying opportunity. The launch of Intel's new AI chip, Gaudi 3, could be a catalyst for a stock trend reversal. INTC's data center positioning and potential sales growth of Gaudi 3 could lead to a re-rating of the stock."
4698509,2024-06-10,"Intel Is Fairly Valued, But Long-Term Challenges Remain (Rating Upgrade)","Intel faced significant earnings and price contraction recently, but conditions are improving. The decline was due to high startup costs, rising competition, and macroeconomic stagnation. INTC faces strong competition from Nvidia, AMD in chips, and TSMC in foundry services. Despite trends in digitization and AI, expecting Intel to match competitors' high growth is overly optimistic. The Company is fairly valued now, unlike its recent overvaluation. This is shown by its low forward price-to-sales ratio and through my DCF model starting with its 10-year average FCF."
4698529,2024-06-11,Intel Can Win Again,"Intel shares have dropped to around $30 per share, presenting a buying opportunity as expectations for the company are low. Tensions between China and Taiwan could disrupt the chip supply chain, making INTC a more attractive option for customers looking to diversify their sources. The Company's competitive pricing and advanced chip offerings, such as the Gaudi 3, could give it an edge over competitors like Nvidia."
4699052,2024-06-13,Intel: Fails To Absorb AI Tailwinds,"Intel's fundamental problems are highlighted by stagnant revenue growth, inability to compete in GPUs, and weak balance sheet. Recent developments reveal missed revenue estimates, weak guidance, and Intel's GPU market share diminishing to zero. Three different valuation approaches signal that the stock is substantially overvalued."
4699278,2024-06-14,"Intel: Turnaround Is Working, I'm Bullish","Intel's stock has dropped almost 40% YTD due to slow traction in AI compute sales and declining share in the data center market. Despite what initially appears to be disappointing Q1 results, Intel is showing signs of a turnaround with revenue growth in key areas and strategic investments. Intel's upcoming launch of the 18A Panther Lake CPUs and strong partnerships position the company for future growth and market leadership. In essence, the turnaround appears to be working under the surface; I am bullish."
4699703,2024-06-17,Intel Continues To Lose To Competition,"I correctly had issued a 'Sell' view for Intel last time, but prematurely changed this, leading to a foregone chance to capture 40.05% of alpha. Now I am reinstating my bearish stance on the stock as I notice that Intel continues to see falling revenues due to loss of share to competition. The company's margins are also likely to be depressed for the rest of FY24 and beyond as their catchup plans on Foundry Technology incurs high costs. I am skeptical of management's optimism and bullish commentary given their track record of disappointments on revenue guidance. Intel also seems overvalued given an unwarranted premium to its historical valuations. Even if one believes in the turnaround, I think the best time to invest is after significant investments are done and before much of the return is realized. Till then, I continue to follow the bearish trend vs. the S&P500."
4699639,2024-06-17,Intel: It's Time To Deliver,"Intel's stock has dropped 40% in 2024 due to disappointing results and competition from companies like Nvidia.

Investors are waiting for Intel to deliver some meaningful earnings improvement to be optimistic about the company's future."
4700146,2024-06-20,Intel's Ambitious Plans Create More Problems Than Benefits,"Intel has been undergoing a massive transformation since 2021 with IDM 2.0, but so far, it has created more problems than benefits. The deprioritized core business has been losing its competitive strength and experiencing macroeconomic weakness. In addition, foundry projects seem to be far in the future, and as projects get delayed, earnings from them become less relevant for today's valuation. INTC stock appears cheap at first glance, but there is no short-term catalyst for upside, leading to my """"Hold"""" rating."

4701114,2024-06-26,Intel: Confronting Industry Shifts And ARM's Dominance,"Intel is adapting to market changes by separating Intel Products and Intel Foundry, positioning both businesses to compete better in their segments. Intel's transparency on the economics of their business can result in both firms pursuing efficiency and growth better than being consolidated into one. Intel is positioning Lunar Lake and Sierra Forest to address the potential disruption ARM poses to its core business. Even if you become more conservative than Intel's assumptions on their financial target model for their foundry to breakeven, Intel at $30 per share is almost 50% undervalued."

The company's margins are expected to improve over time as it nears the end of its transition plan, optimizing its cost structure. INTC's capex growth will continue to slow down as management indicates that FY2024 reaches the peak for the """"5 Nodes In 4 Years"""" plan, driven by factory start-up costs, thereby improving FCF. The stock is currently trading at 17.6x non-GAAP P/E for FY2025 and 1.36x P/B fwd, which is 37% below its 10-year average, indicating an attractive buying opportunity."

However, I think Intel's revenue growth in key segments like CCG and DCAI shows promising signs for future profitability. The company has ambitious goals for its foundry services, hoping to be the second-largest external foundry company by 2030; it has already secured large orders from Microsoft and others. The current EPS forecasts may be too pessimistic if Q1 marked the bottom of the cycle and management's cost-cutting initiatives helped boost Intel's margins already in Q2.

Combined with the uncertain monetization of its foundry ambitions and deteriorating balance sheet, INTC's investment thesis remains underwhelming at these bottom levels.

4723570,2024-09-26,Intel Stock: Time To Double Down,"Despite recent setbacks, I remain optimistic about Intel's long-term goals, including cost reductions, manufacturing capacity increases, and strategic partnerships like the AWS AI chip deal. Intel's Q2 FY2024 results were disappointing, with revenue and margins falling short, but the company's aggressive transformation strategy could yield significant future value. A potential breakup of Intel could unlock substantial shareholder value, with individual segments possibly worth more than the current market cap. Despite risks and competition, I recommend buying INTC stock now, anticipating higher future valuations and potential strategic moves like divestitures or takeovers."
4723492,2024-09-26,Intel's Capitulatory Drop Is A Buying Opportunity For Investors And Industry Peers,"Intel's struggles continue with disappointing earnings, layoffs, and suspended dividends, but potential for recovery exists through foundry development and strategic asset sales. Cost cuts and potential segment sales, including interest from Qualcomm and Apollo Global Management, could drive Intel's turnaround and valuation increase. Intel's future hinges on foundry success, AI and datacenter growth, and overcoming delays and market risks, with a potential share price reaching $25.50-$29.70 before the end of 2024. Risks include delays in development, continued GPU dominance in AI, and a weak Chinese market, which could hinder Intel's recovery and growth prospects."
4724293,2024-10-01,Intel: Spectacular September Comeback,"Intel Corporation's turnaround, led by CEO Pat Gelsinger, focuses on restoring technological competitiveness, with 18A products expected by H2 '25, despite recent revenue declines and layoffs. The reason the turnaround hasn't succeeded is that it only really starts with 18A, which is on track, but ultimately only has an indirect effect on its financial performance/revenue. Intel's stock trades below book value, presenting an investment opportunity based on potential gross and profit margin growth, with a possible return to $30-40 per share. Risks include aligning cost structure with current revenue, but improved economics and cost savings from the reorganization offer a path to profitability. Intel delivered a stacked September with three major leadership product launches. While a Qualcomm merger might secure its financial stability, it is not required."
4725112,2024-10-05,Intel: Too Cheap To Ignore (Technical Analysis),"Intel's stock experienced extreme volatility, plummeting nearly 40% before rebounding 21%, only to drop again after disappointing earnings and cost-cutting measures. Despite the volatility, Intel's price to book ratio is at a 30-year low, presenting a compelling value compared to competitors like AMD, QCOM, and TSM. Chart analysis suggests strong potential for upside, with a significant price gap to fill, indicating a possible 29.83% increase from current levels. While risks remain, Intel's current valuation and industry leadership in CPUs support maintaining a """"buy"""" rating, expecting stabilization and gradual recovery."
4725167,2024-10-06,Intel's AI-Powered Turnaround,"Intel's recent 30% dip presents a golden buying opportunity due to its promising turnaround program aiming to improve AI exposure. Wall Street analysts are optimistic about Intel's turnaround, with EPS expected to rebound significantly in 2025 and beyond, driven by AI advancements. Intel's robust R&D budget, custom AI chips, and governmental support under the CHIPS Act position it well against competitors like Nvidia and AMD. Despite risks like high volatility, leveraged balance sheet, and potential recession, the technical setup suggests a bullish reversal, making Intel a compelling buy."

Management's cost-reduction plan, including layoffs and dividend suspension, aims to improve free cash flow but may hinder long-term growth against competitors like NVIDIA and TSMC. Intel's Data Center and AI unit struggles due to competition and product delays, necessitating strategic clarity and operational efficiency to regain its market position. While INTC may not lead in chip design or foundry services, its role in the global tech ecosystem and current low valuation make it a Buy."
4727977,2024-10-21,Intel: Expect Strong Buying Pressure On Q3 Earnings Release,"Intel's Q2 FY2024 results were disappointing, with revenue and margins falling short of expectations, highlighting ongoing struggles against competitors like AMD and TSMC. Despite recent negative sentiment and downgrades, I believe Intel has a favorable environment to beat Q3 expectations, potentially leading to a stock price recovery. Intel's long-term initiatives, including AI and foundry expansions, are promising but slow-moving, with significant competition and execution risks. I remain neutral on Intel stock due to valuation concerns and high competitive pressures, despite potential short-term positive surprises in the upcoming Q3 report."
4728267,2024-10-22,Intel's Revival May Be Here Sooner Than You Think,"Intel is set to report Q3 earnings on October 31, 2024, with low expectations due to a continual restructuring effort. Intel's potential sale of Altera or Mobileye could raise billions of dollars for the chipmaker, aiding its restructuring and boosting investor confidence in its transformation. Despite low EPS estimates and a distressed valuation, Intel shares could revalue significantly if restructuring progresses and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators gain traction. Risks include continued cash bleeding, failure to catch up in AI accelerators to AMD and Nvidia, and lack of concrete plans for selling standalone businesses, which could disappoint investors."
4730094,2024-10-28,Intel: Make-Or-Break Earnings Moment,"Intel has been one of the worst performers this year, as the stock corrected after every earnings result. Over the past year, I have mentioned that Intel’s main headwind is the wrong strategy within the foundry business where it competes with highly efficient TSM. The upcoming earnings result is a make-or-break moment for the company, and the management needs to provide greater clarity about the future roadmap. The turnaround would not materialize until 2026 which can continue to put pressure on the stock for the next few quarters. Due to enormous challenges facing the company, the stock does not look like a value buy despite the massive correction in YTD."

I think the near-term weakness is already reflected in their stock price, and Intel is making progress on its 18A process launch. Notably, beyond AWS, Intel added two 18A wafer design wins during the quarter from compute centric companies. Intel expects its first external customer to launch their 18A design in the first half of 2025 and enter high-volume production in the first half of 2026. I am upgrading to a “Buy” with a fair value of $28 per share."

4732632,2024-11-04,Intel: Look For Big Downside In 2025 As Semiconductor Cycle Peaks,"Intel reported what appeared to be a """"kitchen sink"""" quarter. The stock fired up in response as investors said the worst was behind them. The larger semiconductor cycle looks to be peaking, and that portends poor things for the sector laggard."
4732862,2024-11-04,Intel: It May Take Some Time,"Intel's financials continue to be awful. Heavy capex spending is necessary but likely won't yield financial benefits for the company for some years. Despite poor financials, high trading volume suggests potential institutional accumulation, anticipating positive developments at Intel. We rate the stock at Accumulate with an eye to replicating what we believe to be large-investor accumulation."
4732839,2024-11-04,Intel: Small Step In The Right Direction,"Intel beat street revenue estimates for Q3, but badly missed on the bottom line. Management provided a decent current quarter forecast. The company's balance sheet worsened in Q3, and remains deep in a net debt situation."
4732647,2024-11-04,Intel: The Worst Is Over,"Intel reported worse-than-expected Q3 results, driven by non-recurring charges. The top line beat estimates, however, and the Q4 outlook is solid. Intel has likely seen the worst already, with a $16.6B quarterly loss in Q3. Sentiment is so strained, that despite $18.5B in impairment and restructuring charges, Intel's share price rallied 8% after earnings. INTC stock is trading at a FY 2025 P/E ratio of 22X, which is significantly below its longer-term historical average P/E ratio."

4733131,2024-11-05,Intel Q3: Mr. Market Was Wrong About Earnings,"Intel's Q3 earnings showed a slight revenue beat but a big earnings miss due to restructuring charges, leading to a mixed market reaction. Despite some positive signs in cost-cutting and segment growth, Intel's lowered guidance and ongoing challenges suggest caution. Intel's Foundry business has potential but remains unproven, with significant investments and some early wins, including a partnership with AWS. Given the current uncertainties and technical indicators, I maintain a Hold rating on Intel, seeing no compelling reason to buy or sell."
4733046,2024-11-05,"Intel: Business Improving, Financials Not Yet","Intel's """"5 nodes in 4 years"""" roadmap and restructuring aim to improve profitability, though substantial revenue growth seems unlikely in the near to mid term. Q3 results showed a 6% YoY revenue decline and non-GAAP EPS of -$0.46, indicating no recovery from the mid-2022 revenue decline. Foundry, Mobileye, and AI businesses could offer some revenue growth over time. Despite potential profitability improvements, the reorganization's early stage suggests no immediate rush to invest in Intel stock."
4733034,2024-11-05,"Intel: Enterprise AI, Going Where The Money Will Be","The Q3 earnings result is decent, but investors need a long-term view, as Intel's foundry's long lead time continues to negatively affect its consolidated margin. INTC's extensive presence in the enterprise will be an edge as it focuses its AI strategy on this segment. Retrieval-augmented generation and small language model can be the catalyst the Company needs to gain traction in the booming AI market. Acquisition interest in Intel improves the odds for investors, as this can limit the potential downside."

4734828,2024-11-08,Intel: Possible Turnaround Due To Its CPU Dominance In PCs And Data Center Market,"Intel's stock is undervalued, presenting a compelling investment opportunity due to its dominant market position and significant progress in manufacturing technology. The company's restructuring initiatives are showing success, with improved profitability and substantial cost reductions, including a workforce reduction of 16,500 employees. INTC's strong market positions in data center CPUs and PC processors, along with new product launches, underscore its growth potential and resilience. Government support and strategic partnerships, such as the collaboration with AWS, bolster Intel's manufacturing capabilities and financial recovery, enhancing its long-term prospects."
4736197,2024-11-11,Intel Stock: It's Not Too Late To Buy The Dip,"I maintain my bullish rating on Intel, believing the stock is undervalued after its massive YoY drop, presenting a buying opportunity for brave medium-term investors. Despite Q3 2024 challenges, Intel's cost reduction and new product launches, like new processors for AI, could drive recovery and future growth. Intel's partnership with AMD and AWS, along with ambitious restructuring, aims to regain market share and improve financial performance. I think that INTC will continue to make efforts, and somewhere in 2025, we might see a turnaround in the company's fortunes, which could lead to the stock's medium-term growth. My valuation calculations say that the stock is undervalued by 31% over the next 2 years as the firm emerges from its challenging period."
4736270,2024-11-12,Intel: The Bottom Is In,"The Company's third-quarter earnings were poor due to ongoing restructuring, but the market's muted reaction suggests optimism for future improvements. Intel Foundry's significant losses are a major concern; divesting it could allow Intel to focus on profitable segments like Client Computing and Data Center. INTC's AI accelerator Gaudi 3 and AI PC growth are promising, potentially driving future sales and profitability. Intel's stock is undervalued with a favorable risk/reward ratio, and successful restructuring could lead to substantial revaluation and profit growth."
4738064,2024-11-16,Intel: There's Light At The End Of The Tunnel (Technical Analysis),"Intel stock is currently undervalued with revenue stabilizing, despite weak earnings and bearish technical signals in the short term. Intermediate-term technicals show positive signs, including narrowing moving average gaps and bullish indicators, suggesting potential for a trend reversal. The long-term outlook remains uncertain, but bullish divergences in indicators hint at a possible bottom for Intel stock.

Despite a +30% recovery from its August 2024 low, the stock has underperformed the broader market and semiconductor peers, highlighting its ongoing struggles. INTC's restructuring, including layoffs and reduced capex, contrasts sharply with its competitors' intensified investments during the AI capex boom, further dampening its growth prospects. The management's $100B foundry ambitions are likely to trigger further headwinds in its Free Cash Flow generation and balance sheet health over the next few years. This is also why we believe INTC may be a potential value trap, with its seemingly low stock prices coming with mixed growth potential."

Prospective new CEO Lip-Bu Tan has a stellar track record at Cadence Design and intimate knowledge of Intel, with a clear idea of what different things ought to be done. Matt Murphy's successful turnaround at Marvell also makes him a candidate for Intel's CEO position, but he is committed to Marvell, making his Intel appointment unlikely. Lip-Bu Tan is my base case for most likely CEO. I expect his appointment to lead to operating margin improvement driven by cuts to bloated middle management personnel at Intel. I expect the new CEO's compensation to be generous, potentially exceeding Gelsinger's 2021 package."
4742615,2024-12-06,Intel: The Problems Gelsinger Leaves Behind,"Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger's departure highlights Intel's struggles with semiconductor leadership and competition from Nvidia, leading to revenue loss and market cap decline. Gelsinger's unrealistic goals and managerial style led to misrepresented progress, culminating in the failure of the """"5 nodes in 4 years"""" strategy. Intel's data center business suffered due to Nvidia's superior GPU technology, with Intel's attempts like Ponte Vecchio failing to compete effectively.

4753602,2025-01-30,Intel: The Empire Strikes Back,"Intel Corporation's Q4 earnings showed weak results year-over-year (as expected) but significant sequential improvement, supporting our view that the turnaround is underway. It was a great print overall. Margins improved sequentially, with adjusted gross margins approaching 40%, driven by cost cuts and efficiencies, though still down from last year. Segment performance showed positive trends in each segment, but data center and AI was only modestly better than Q3. The Q1 outlook is a bit light, but we have argued the true inflection would take place after Q1 2025. INTC shares are up right now, but we think a new CEO has a massive opportunity to really take the company meaningfully into the future."
4753856,2025-01-31,"Intel Q4: There's No Good News Here, Sell Now","Intel Corporation has underperformed the S&P500 since my last 'Sell' update on the stock, and Q4 FY2024 results provide fresh reasons to remain bearish. INTC delivered weak revenue guidance that has become a norm. Q1 FY2025 revenues are expected to fall 11-18% QoQ due to seasonality but also a whole litany of other reasons. Intel's data center business' outlook is hit with the rude shock of cancellations and further delays of long-awaited product launches. The Panther Lake CPU launch is a positive catalyst to look out for in H2 FY2025. Also, keep on eye on the bleeding FCF trends every quarter. INTC stock is trading near fair value on a 1-yr fwd P/E basis, and the long-term technicals remain firmly bearish."
4753807,2025-01-31,Intel Q4: Can They Turn It Around?,"Intel Corporation faces significant challenges, including shrinking market share and revenue, but has a solid turnaround plan addressing core issues. The plan includes new manufacturing projects, a foundry business spin-off, and partnerships with AWS to regain technology leadership. Despite recent losses, Intel's financial strength, with $24B in cash and strategic investments, supports its recovery efforts. INTC investors should brace for volatility as Intel navigates fierce competition and executes its turnaround strategy."
4753790,2025-01-31,Intel: Too Early To Bet On A Turnaround,"I believe Intel lacks a clear strategy to regain data center and AI market share. Interim leadership likely won’t drive significant changes until a permanent CEO is appointed. Q4 and FY 2024 results were a mixed bag. Intel exceeded EPS and revenue expectations for Q4 2024 but provided guidance for Q1 2025 that fell short of analysts' expectations. INTC reported a record net loss in Q3 2024 due to impairments, restructuring costs, and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, which the market viewed positively. I find Intel's valuation appealing, trading significantly below AMD, ARM, and TSMC on valuation metrics like EV/EBITDA and P/CF. However, Intel needs a strong narrative. I suggest holding until the new CEO outlines a clear turnaround plan, as AMD and ARM continue to outperform Intel in the data center segment."

Intel Products' CCG surprisingly delivered a revenue decline YoY due to competition. This is disturbing as this segment will face more competition this year from new entrants. While Intel Foundry is the future growth driver, it will take time because of the long product cycle and experience curve associated with 18A. At Intel's current price of around $19 per share, you are buying it at half the intrinsic value of the Product team and everything else for free."
4755563,2025-02-06,Intel Q4: 18A Products Can Mark Its Turning Point,"A few new catalysts have fundamentally shifted INTC stock’s return/risk curve since my last writing. First, its Q4 earnings are far better than I expected/feared, dramatically reducing my concerns over its financial resources. Second, the progress with its 18A products could be a pivotal moment for Intel’s multi-year turnaround plan. I see good odds for volume production in 2025, which should further strengthen its profits and also AI products."
4755486,2025-02-06,Intel Q4: Too Early To Bet On A 2026 Turnaround,"Despite beating 4Q FY2024 revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates, Intel's muted price action reflects a gloomy 1Q FY2025 outlook, with a fourth consecutive YoY revenue decline. Some PC demand was pulled forward in 4Q due to potential Trump-era tariffs, which could pressure 1Q revenue while operating cost reductions will not contribute until later. Optimism remains for Intel's FY2026 roadmap, with higher gross margin 18A chips and reduced operating expenses expected, which can re-accelerate growth and profitability. The company's limited capex can alleviate FCF decline, but it may be challenging to catch the industry amidst the AI race.

There were some positive aspects of the speech, like the focus on a more innovative culture and reducing the bloated middle management layer. However, a big negative was the emphasis to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and build a “world-class foundry” which would be a long and an expensive effort. Intel is planning on launching its 18A process node in the second half of this year and using the massive R&D expense to build a more innovative company. Intel stock is trading at 19.3 times the EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending Dec 2026, which is not cheap and makes the stock a Hold at the current price."

4788420,2025-05-20,Intel: The Future Is Bright (Upgrade),"Intel's turnaround is gaining momentum under new leadership, focusing on aggressive cost-cutting, restructuring, and divestitures to streamline operations and boost profitability. Foundry growth and operating expense reduction are key catalysts for profit growth, with the U.S. chip manufacturing shift providing long-term opportunities despite current losses. Intel's cost-cutting measures, including significant layoffs, are already improving operating margins and could unlock substantial earnings power masked by restructuring efforts. If Intel executes on cost reduction and narrows Foundry losses, the stock could re-rate to $34, offering 55% upside, though risks remain if the turnaround falters."
4789306,2025-05-22,Intel Doesn't Need To Beat TSMC To Win - Nearing $20 Buy Signal,"Intel Corporation is our swing trade safe haven: buy under $20, sell above $23, and hold for the 18A node catalyst into 2026. 18A node is a game-changer with GAA and backside power; it'll enable share gain on PC Client from AMD and put IFS on the map against TSMC. Valuation is attractive, with INTC stock trading at a significant discount to peers, and expectations are getting revised down making for an easier beat. With new leadership and a clear catalyst, Intel is a buy under $20, with the potential to return to the $40s after 18A's success. Intel's 18A will carry it to new heights, and the more negative the market gets on this name, the more attractive it is to us."
