4231352,2019-01-03,Quantifying Johnson & Johnson's Contingent Liabilities,"We're not jumping to any conclusions regarding J&J's contingent legal liabilities with respect to alleged behavior. J&J's share price has already factored in some of the expectations regarding any actions to remedy the situation. We expect modest upside on the basis of our fair value estimate, but investors should always view value as a range of outcomes. We do not expect contingent legal liabilities to have any impact on the company's future dividend growth trajectory."
4232927,2019-01-12,Johnson & Johnson: Remember 'Our Credo'?,"J&J has long held to operating with an established set of values known as """"Our Credo""""; which serves to guide its actions and decisions. Proving it put people before profits, J&J’s actions in the 1982 Tylenol contamination case set the company up as the Gold Standard for crisis management. Management matters. Those who were involved in the 1982 case are long retired. The recent history of actions and decisions by J&J’s senior managers seem inconsistent with their credo."
4233865,2019-01-17,Johnson & Johnson: P/E Matters,"The only way an investor can realize a return from an investment in shares is through receipt of dividends and/or gains on sales. I repeat - it is the only way. No matter how good a company, the share price can be too high. Conversely, even for a less attractive company, a low share price can offer superior risk-adjusted returns. There are some who say buying at a P/E ratio of 15.0 is just about right. At Analysts’ Corner, we believe that approach requires modification based on target company circumstances. Let’s take a look at what might be a reasonable P/E ratio for Johnson & Johnson and what share buy price might deliver an acceptable total return."
4235062,2019-01-23,Reasons To Avoid J&J Now Relate To Other Safe Havens,"JNJ had a mostly in-line quarter, with deflationary pressures on Xarelto and unimpressive numbers from the Actelion products. The more important story was for 2019 guidance for almost zero revenue growth. If JNJ plans to grow several points slower than global GDP, why is it at a premium valuation, even without taking the many lawsuits it is fighting into account? More broadly, several large cap """"steady Eddie"""" consumer products or pharma companies trade at rich multiples despite slow or no growth and often strongly negative tangible net worth. JNJ and many other """"safe havens"""" may currently be priced for negative alpha."
4235394,2019-01-24,Johnson & Johnson: Goodbye Growth,Johnson & Johnson has seen a real growth slowdown at the end of 2018. Investors should embrace themselves for lower growth in 2019 as well. Slower growth and recent turmoil regarding asbestos claims make me cautious as shares have held up quite well.
4235245,2019-01-24,Covered-Call Writing With J&J,"Covered-call writing is one of my favorite strategies to generate monthly income while mitigating downside risk. J&J is a perfect stock to write calls against. After analyzing the theoretical options pricing, I'm looking to sell the in-the-money calls."
4235692,2019-01-25,Buy Johnson & Johnson For Safe Increasing Income With Dividend Increase Coming In April,"Johnson & Johnson is extremely well-diversified in the medical health field with new drugs leading the way; the company has a defensive business that will make money even in difficult times. Johnson & Johnson has increased its dividend for 56 years in a row (a dividend king) and presently has a yield of 2.8%, which is above average. Johnson & Johnson’s total return underperformed the DOW average for my 48-month test period by 2.24%, which is fair, but the company has increasing earnings and dividends looking forward."

4240919,2019-02-14,Johnson & Johnson: Regulatory Headwinds Compromise Half Of Future Revenue Streams,"Recently uncovered internal documents corroborate allegations of Johnson & Johnson's culpability in the development of cancer in thousands of individuals. A rule change proposal put forth by the Trump Administration marks the end of the current pharmaceutical industry rebate system. Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical segment is heavily reliant on exclusionary rebate bundles to curb competition. With no apparent means for prevention or circumvention of the rule change, nearly half of Johnson & Johnson revenues are at high risk."
4242213,2019-02-19,Johnson & Johnson Looks Undervalued: Time To Buy?,Johnson & Johnson is a rock-solid business. The company has an impeccable track record of cash generation and dividend payments. The baby powder controversy and competition from biosimilars are generating uncertainty around Johnson & Johnson. Those uncertainties are already incorporated into valuation levels. Short-term risk could be creating a buying opportunity for long-term investors.
4247270,2019-03-08,Johnson & Johnson: Brace For Impact,"A number of its major drugs are facing difficulty as competition is kicking in both nationally and internationally. Pricing pressure resulting from both the administration and competition and a strengthening dollar could hurt the financials. History indicates that there might be a reduction in the $4.69 punitive and compensatory damages charged against Johnson. Dividend safety looks strong as indicated by FCFE and FCFF coverage ratios. The stock looks overvalued, but it is a hold given the firm’s substantial market position."
4248004,2019-03-12,Why Johnson & Johnson Is Still An Attractive Investment,Johnson & Johnson has steadily performed during every economic cycle. The company is one of two with a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is finding ways to grow despite its massive size. We conclude why I believe JNJ is a buy based on yield and DCF value.
4251061,2019-03-26,Johnson & Johnson Vs. Pfizer: Which Big Pharma Giant Is The Better Dividend Stock?,"Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer are both mega-cap healthcare stocks that pay dividends to shareholders. However, they have somewhat different business models, and have different dividend yields and histories of dividend increases. While both companies are highly profitable and have secure dividends, Johnson & Johnson seems to be the better long-term stock."
4251057,2019-03-26,Johnson & Johnson: Forget About Talc And Focus On The Upcoming Dividend Hike,"JNJ has grown its dividend for 56 consecutive years and is expected to raise its dividend next month. The pharmaceutical segment, which generates half of the total sales, is firing on all cylinders. The stock is remarkably cheap, mostly due to the pending issue with its baby powder. Investors should not expect to find this exceptional stock at much cheaper levels."
4253889,2019-04-11,"Johnson & Johnson: Solid, Stable Returns, But Pfizer A Better Prospect","As of April 5, Johnson & Johnson shares closed at $136.18. The share price has shown fairly steady growth, from ~$70 in 2012 to the current level. The steady share price growth and regular increasing dividend payments have provided solid, stable returns for investors over the past 6 years. This is the only way an investor can realize a return from an investment in shares, through receipt of dividends, and/or gains on sales. Analysts' Corner proprietary 1View∞Scenarios dashboards are used to assess whether Johnson & Johnson investors can reasonably expect to enjoy returns in the future similar to those available over the past six years. Historical and projected rates of return for Johnson & Johnson are compared to similar data for Pfizer - with Pfizer, perhaps surprisingly, coming out a clear winner."
4255101,2019-04-17,Johnson & Johnson Looks To Help Type 2 Diabetes Patients With Key Advancement,Johnson & Johnson announced that it had achieved positive results in a phase 3 study using INVOKANA along with standard of care to treat type 2 diabetes patients. The most notable finding from the study is that INVOKANA was shown to be able to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease for these type 2 diabetes patients by 32%. The company has already submitted its sNDA for INVOKANA to treat patients with type 2 diabetes who have kidney disease. INVOKANA is the first medicine in nearly 20 years to be able to show the ability to reduce progression to renal failure in this patient population.
4256159,2019-04-24,Things To Consider Before Buying Johnson & Johnson At $140,"Johnson & Johnson appears undervalued because its 16X P/E is below its historical norms. However, the business has evolved where an added presence from pharmaceuticals has brought increased risk to the company. We would like to see a small pullback to create a margin of safety in what remains a top-notch company and stock."
4257837,2019-04-29,Johnson & Johnson Comes Out Of Gate With First Approval For Targeted Bladder Cancer Therapy,"Johnson & Johnson received FDA approval for BALVERSA specifically tailored for patients with metastatic bladder cancer who have specific genetic alterations. FDA approval was based on a single-arm phase 2 trial in which treatment with BALVERSA resulted with a 32% overall response rate. A companion diagnostic, known as therascreen FGFR RGQ RT-PCR Kit, was also approved in tandem with BALVERSA. The ability for J&J to get BALVERSA approved for patients with metastatic bladder cancer with specific FGFR genetic alterations means a more targeted treatment approach with less off-target effects."
4267606,2019-05-31,"Johnson & Johnson: Shareholder-Friendly, With A Caveat","Johnson & Johnson shares have provided good returns to shareholders over the last 7 years through dividend and share price growth. But, there is a caveat related to growth rates. At Analysts' Corner, we believe demystifying the financial statements of corporations, including the impact of share repurchases, is a good start to empowering investors to make informed decisions. We also understand there is almost always a dichotomy between the perceived financial performance of a company and the returns achieved by shareholders. The reason for this dichotomy - the only way an investor can realize a return from an investment in shares - is through receipt of dividends and/or gains on sales, regardless of company performance."
4267805,2019-06-02,Johnson & Johnson - Experiencing Buyer's Remorse,JNJ is teaching investors the importance of valuation. I now realize that JNJ is best purchased closer to the historically low valuation ratios. I overpaid without clearly assessing the risks like the Oklahoma opioid litigation. Investors could get better entry points in this panic environment.
4271050,2019-06-19,Building A Bulletproof Portfolio Around Johnson & Johnson,"There's an interesting disconnect between Seeking Alpha contributors' sentiment on Johnson & Johnson (on average, bullish) and Seeking Alpha Essential's Quant Rating on the stock (neutral). Given the disconnect, Johnson & Johnson seemed like a good candidate for a """"bulletproof"""" or hedged portfolio where the goal is to maximize returns while strictly limiting risk. I describe how you can build one of these portfolios yourself and present an example of one."

4272220,2019-06-26,Johnson & Johnson Looks To Blood Cancer Drug Successor With Early-Stage Deal,"Johnson & Johnson teams up again with Genmab, this time to bring a potential successor to Darzalex known as HexaBody-CD38. The reasoning for developing HexaBody-CD38 is to not only go after multiple myeloma but also be used for many other types of indications including other types of cancer. Darzalex is a top-selling drug producing as much as $2.02 billion in sales in 2018, and the expectation to possibly earn $3 billion in 2019. The total payout amount from Johnson & Johnson to Genmab for the partnership could end up being over $1.1 billion when all is said and done with all milestone payments."

Multiple methodologies provide a fair value appraisal and are used to formulate EII strategies targeting >12% annualized yield while reducing market risk 5%.
4273893,2019-07-08,Johnson & Johnson: 8-9% Annual Total Return Potential Makes This Dividend Aristocrat A Hold,"Having raised its dividend every year since the Kennedy administration, Johnson & Johnson is on the prestigious Dividend Kings list. Despite the risks of being a scapegoat of the opioid crisis and the ongoing talc-based product lawsuits, Johnson & Johnson boasts the distinction of an AAA credit rating. In addition, the company is likely to benefit from increased healthcare spending as the world grows wealthier, larger, and older. Johnson & Johnson also possesses a proven management team. Unfortunately, the company is trading at a 9% premium to my estimated fair value and at a 4% premium to my target price. Between the 2.7% yield, 6-7% earnings growth, and 0.4% valuation multiple contraction, Johnson & Johnson will likely deliver annual total returns of 8.3-9.3% over the next decade."
4274264,2019-07-10,2 Reasons Johnson & Johnson Is A Buy And 4 Reasons It Is Not,"JNJ possesses significant competitive advantages as a result of its massive size, scale, and intellectual property library. These competitive advantages along with strong demand for healthcare and pharmaceutical products give them solid growth potential. JNJ still faces considerable litigation, regulatory, and competitive risks. The yield, earnings multiple, and earnings per share growth outlook provide a decent total return outlook but not particularly attractive. I offer my take on the security at these prices."

Johnson & Johnson has increased its dividend for 57 years in a row (a dividend king) and presently has a yield of 2.8%, which is above average. Johnson & Johnson’s total return underperformed the DOW average for my 55-month test period by 12.18%, which is fair for a company that has increased revenues, earnings, and dividends.

That is still my base case, however, a verdict in Oklahoma is due by end of August, prosecutors asking for $17B from J&J for its involvement in the opioid epidemic. I believe J&J will win, but if they don't, it opens the door for a speculated $100B master settlement that could bankrupt the companies exposed in the Post."

Much of the treatment talk has been about Gilead's remdesivir, and Feuerstein - who has been at the center of much of the reporting - takes us through those ups and downs. Gilead reports after the close on Thursday. It's possible that alongside, the company might publish and discuss results from one of its remdesivir trials. Results from the most important study - the one being done by the U.S. government - are expected in mid-May. Even if all goes great with remdesivir, it's only a treatment, and will only be effective on certain patients. The world ultimately needs a vaccine, and vaccines take time - 12-18 months in a best-case scenario."
4341259,2020-04-29,Johnson & Johnson: Waiting For A Discount For This Solid Dividend Growth Healthcare Company,"Johnson & Johnson has provided a steady record of revenue growth, high profitability and manageable long-term debt. The company’s expansion of drug indications and strong drug pipeline offer many opportunities to continue driving growth for the company. Johnson & Johnson faces key lawsuits and challenges that may not justify the high current P/E Ratio. Taken together, Johnson & Johnson has the potential to reward shareholders though the current share price is high considering risks."
4340994,2020-04-29,Beloved Johnson & Johnson Shares Are Too Expensive,"Though I love the company, JNJ is trading at a 17.4x earnings multiple despite the earnings guidance cut of 15% for the year. JNJ shares have rebounded sharply from their March lows to the tune of 40%. The Medical Device segment, which accounts for 29% of sales, was impacted in Q1 and is expected to be heavily impacted in Q2 as well."
4351643,2020-06-03,Johnson & Johnson: Built To Last,"Johnson & Johnson is built to last with diverse revenue streams and strong competitive advantages in many of its markets. It has performed well both during the COVID-19 pandemic and in past market calamities. The company's shares are not cheap, but their durability and safety warrant the premium pricing."
4352402,2020-06-07,The #1 Pick In Health Care: Johnson & Johnson,"Johnson & Johnson is undervalued against an expensive U.S. stock market, with a lower P/E and higher dividend yield. Diversified consumer/pharma/medical product sales are as close to recession-proof as you can find. Investor buying momentum remains strong in 2020, as represented by a number of technical indicators. Reviewing the whole investment story, the company may represent the best """"risk-adjusted"""" investment choice in today's health care sector."

4358887,2020-07-16,Johnson & Johnson: Failing Upwards,JNJ trades close to all-time highs despite earnings falling 35% in the quarter. A promising COVID-19 vaccine is far behind the competition and the company has no plans to profit off the vaccine. The low dividend yield continues to be a valuation warning for the stock. JNJ hasn't produced any results worthy of all-time highs while still facing a long list of lawsuits.
4359258,2020-07-19,Johnson & Johnson: This Dividend Aristocrat Is Ready To Break Out,"JNJ is a Dow Jones Industrial Average component that makes consumer packaged goods, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals. JNJ's consumer brands and health care assets are mostly more valuable in a post COVID-19 world, and especially on a relative basis compared to the broader equity landscape. JNJ equity yields about 2.7% and the dividend is not likely to be cut soon. The company is not merely an aristocrat, but also a dividend king. JNJ is one of the largest components in high quality and high yield ETFs, both of which are likely to receive increasing allocations."

Johnson & Johnson's total return beats the Dow average by 12.70% for my 56-month test period, which is great for a stable company that has increased earnings, and dividends. Johnson & Johnson recently announced it is buying Momenta for $6.5 Billion, and this is one way the company grows. Johnson & Johnson is extremely well diversified in the medical health field with new drugs leading the way, and the company is a defensive business that will make money even in a recession."

4378995,2020-10-14,Johnson & Johnson: Still No Reason To Own,"JNJ easily beat reduced Q3 earnings estimates. The healthcare company guided up for 2020, but the new estimates are still down $1 from original targets. The stock continues to underperform the market due to an expensive multiple from the dividend aristocrat status. Investors should only buy JNJ on dips."
4379209,2020-10-15,Johnson & Johnson Curiously Valued In A Still-Healthy Med-Tech Sector,"Johnson & Johnson beat expectations by a comfortable margin in Q3'20, driven by the device business, but investors seem concerned about the risk that the procedure recovery is stalling. The pause in the Phase III SARS-CoV2 vaccine trial is unwelcome news, but I don't expect the vaccine to be a major long-term driver for JNJ's earnings and cash flow. Johnson & Johnson has long been dogged about growth concerns, and improved R&D productivity would certainly help, but I believe the company can maintain a 3% long-term trajectory. Between cash flow growth, margins, and other factors, I believe Johnson & Johnson is undervalued below $160 with upside to close to $180."
4379173,2020-10-15,Johnson & Johnson: Great Company To Buy And Hold,"Johnson & Johnson's stock dropped somewhat after its earnings announcement. The company beat analysts' estimates but the market reacted to the bad Covid-19 vaccine news. I do not think the vaccine news is a blow to the company's future profitability. Johnson & Johnson is a wonderful company, which does not look expensive compared to the overall stock market."
4383436,2020-11-01,Johnson & Johnson: The Ultimate Retirement Super SWAN Is Now On Sale,"Johnson & Johnson, normally a defensive stock, has fallen more than the S&P 500 during this downturn. That creates a potentially good opportunity for long-term investors to lock in some very attractive volatility-adjusted returns. JNJ's profitability is among the best of any big pharma company or any company in the world."
4384502,2020-11-03,Johnson & Johnson Looks Vulnerable After Falling From Highs,"Johnson & Johnson’s earnings results for the third-quarter period indicated strength in pharmaceutical demand medical device sales. However, the company has faced critical obstacles during this coronavirus trading period and this has adversely impacted a key dividend stock that might otherwise be making YTD highs. As a result of these events and trends, this great dividend stock (with its 2.95% yield) is heading lower after posting marginal highs near $157 on April 23rd, 2020. In this low-interest rate environment, Johnson & Johnson is still looking vulnerable but we saw strength in the company’s top-line and bottom-line figures and investors can add to long positions near the $126.40 level."
4387272,2020-11-10,Vaccine Developments Knock Election News Off Front Page - Scott Martin Joins Alpha Trader,"This week's Alpha Trader podcast features hosts Aaron Task and Stephen Alpher talking with Scott Martin, head of research at Kramer Capital Research. What might have been an episode focusing on the ramifications of last week's elections instead was dominated by Monday morning's vaccine update. Martin reminds that the Pfizer news might not be the golden bullet that ends the pandemic, and suggests the market - the Dow up 5% at the time of recording on Monday - may be over-reacting. Treasurys are trash, says Martin, and investors in search of yield should look to safe dividend plays - there are plenty out there with perhaps better credit than the U.S. Treasury. Last week's elections bode well for potential federal de-criminalization of marijuana, but Martin would stay away from the commodity growers. Instead look for those companies that might benefit from the consumer product angle."

Pandemic pressure have hit Medical Devices hard in 2020 - sales are down ~15% - but these ought to be recouped rapidly as conditions hopefully ease. JNJ's COVID-19 vaccine is another potential catalyst - with an interim data readout expected very soon. JNJ will operate a not-for-profit pricing strategy, but there's arguably more upside here. Analysts make the company a buy with a ~$170 price target, and I concur, based on DCF analysis. A company-wide 5% CAGR may be achievable - coupled with a growing dividend JNJ stock looks attractive."

A vaccine may not have any impact on JNJ financially. It may appear irrational that vaccine results would impact the stock. JNJ's revenue is growing in the high-single-digit percentage range, phenomenal for a company of its size. JNJ's revenue and operating income should improve once the economy reopens. Buy JNJ."

But even taking all this into account, these NYU numbers, if they are indeed what they seem, would indicate that the single-dose J&J vaccination might well have a greater chance of losing efficacy against variant strains. But we also should be collecting data on the far smaller cohort who have shown serious disease after having been vaccinated, and see if there’s a trend for single-shot J&J patients to stand out in that group."

JNJ is one of the oldest companies on the NYSE but time is catching up with this company's financial performance which is showing signs of decline. JNJ's future growth is vested with its Pharmaceutical division. Revenues from the division have grown in step with the market. Pharma businesses are reliant on the output quality of their R&D investments both internally generated and via acquisitions. JNJ's internal processes appear sound but one major acquisition has dragged down the financial performance of the company. Some investors are attracted by JNJ's reliable performance and dividend but I suspect that there are better places to invest over the long term.

The distribution of its Covid jabs has partly coincided with the intent of separating the consumer health business from the rest of JNJ, thus becoming more agile. The resulting Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices business, or new JNJ aims to offer integrated care to patients with major unmet medical needs, with Covid constituting an example. This is a strategic turning point for the giant and comparison with peers shows that it is undervalued given potential revenue and cost synergies."

The medical devices division has recovered from pandemic headwinds but offers incremental growth only - could management offload it? The above 4 issues are what I expect to dominate proceedings when Q1 2023 earnings are announced premarket on April 18 - JNJ tends to beat earnings estimates, but I am not sure it will tomorrow, I'd expect a slight correction."

I discuss the company's recent earnings performance and the likelihood of an earnings beat on Tuesday, when J&J reports its first quarter results. I explore the question of whether JNJ stock should possibly be considered """"3M 2.0"""" or whether fears of potentially devastating litigation costs are overblown. I model the impact of the now significantly higher talc litigation expenses on JNJ's DCF valuation, taking into account that the new reorganization plan is apparently strongly supported by claimants."

The company is reinventing itself as a pharmaceuticals specialist after spinning out its consumer health division. Ironically, consumer health has been performing well - as has MedTech - these divisions will stabilize Q2 earnings. Management has promised that its focus on drug development will result in Pharmaceuticals revenues of >$60bn in FY25. I find that hard to believe. Litigation remains a problem - witness the $6.9bn write-down in Q123. JNJ is moving against its reputation as a solid blue chip, and I'm expecting further declines in the share price in 2023."

4625049,2023-08-07,Future Prospects For Johnson & Johnson Following Strong Q2 Performance,"On July 20, Johnson & Johnson, the mastodon of the healthcare sector, released its financial results for the 2nd quarter of 2023. However, those results were overshadowed by a federal judge's decision to dismiss a JNJ subsidiary's bankruptcy filing that sought to resolve thousands of lawsuits related to the talc crisis. The total sales of Darzalex amounted to $2.43 billion for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 22.4% compared to the previous year. On June 6, 2023, Johnson & Johnson filed a sBLA seeking approval for Carvykti as a treatment for patients with RRMM who had previously received at least one prior line of therapy.

It looks like a """"once and for all"""" resolution regarding J&J's talc lawsuits is now off the table, and the company could face time-consuming litigation on a case-by-case basis. I share my outlook on Johnson & Johnson's talc lawsuits, and the potential consequences of Judge Kaplan's recent ruling. I take a closer look at the case of Emory Hernandez Valadez, who was awarded $18.8 million despite (or because of?) his particular case, and discuss what this could mean for future cases. I model the impact of a conservative $15 billion (previously $9 billion) impact from talc lawsuits on the valuation of JNJ stock."

Kenvue: The Better Dividend Aristocrat Might Shock You,"Kenvue Inc. is the largest OTC drug company on earth, with the most trusted brands and impressive free cash flow margins that are expected to keep improving over time. It's likely to become a dividend king next year when Kenvue confirms it will keep raising the dividend each year. Kenvue is an A-rated company whose leverage ratio is expected to decline and potentially achieve an A+ rating by 2027. Kenvue is about 18% undervalued, offering about 11% return potential through 2028, about 2X that of Johnson & Johnson. One is the better dividend growth stock, but the one you should own depends on whether you're seeking maximum safe income over time, or the 2nd best risk-free stock returns in America."
4630884,2023-08-24,Johnson & Johnson: Kenvue Separation Won't Impact Dividends,Johnson & Johnson recently completed the Kenvue spinoff. We outline the impacts on its dividend payouts from this spinoff. I analyzed its dividend payout both using simple payout ratios and also using a more holistic approach such as the dividend cushion ratio. I don’t see negative impacts from the separation. I actually see enhanced dividend safety and plenty of room for continued dividend growth.
4635622,2023-09-17,Johnson & Johnson: AAA-Rated And Potentially 20% Undervalued,"Johnson & Johnson is attractively valued and well-positioned for long-term growth, with a 3.0% dividend yield and a AAA-rated balance sheet. The company has faced challenges due to the baby powder controversy, but its stock has shown resilience in the face of bad news. Johnson & Johnson's commitment to R&D, dividend growth, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation make it an appealing investment choice for stability and long-term potential."
4635885,2023-09-18,Johnson & Johnson: A Very Cautious 'Buy',"Johnson & Johnson reported solid second quarter results - with MedTech reporting double-digit growth - and raised its full-year guidance for fiscal 2023. Kenvue is now a stand-alone company, and investors traded 191 million Johnson & Johnson shares for Kenvue shares. While I still remain cautious about Johnson & Johnson, it is a stable and solid business, and the stock could be slightly undervalued."
4635728,2023-09-18,Johnson & Johnson's Reinvention - Is A New Logo Enough?,"Johnson & Johnson's strategic transformation, marked by the split-off of its consumer health division, is a significant shift in its corporate strategy. The company aims to streamline its operations, boost margins, and reintroduce growth. However, there are some concerns to discuss. While JNJ stock may not offer substantial potential for equity appreciation, it remains an attractive choice for income-seeking investors. There are also some implications from the Kenvue deal. The transformation brings its share of challenges, including potential threats to revenue from expiring drug patents and increased competition."
4635669,2023-09-18,Johnson & Johnson: Kenvue Spin-Off Unlikely To Drive Market-Beating Returns,"Johnson & Johnson had spun off Kenvue, its consumer health division, to boost growth in its more profitable pharmaceutical and medical technology sectors. JNJ achieved a steady 3.3% revenue growth over the past decade with a stable 26.6% average operating margin, showing resilience even during market turbulence. While analysts predict an annualized EPS growth of 4%, I hold a more optimistic view, expecting JNJ to achieve approximately 5% EPS growth over the next decade. Based on my analysis, if the anticipated EPS growth materializes, we could potentially see the stock price reach $219 by the end of 2031, resulting in a total return of nearly 7%, factoring in dividends. For JNJ, a company with a AAA credit rating, I recommend a Hold rating for investors seeking to outperform the market and achieve dividend growth exceeding JNJ's 5-year average of 5.92%."
4636898,2023-09-23,Johnson & Johnson: The Bull Case Can No Longer Be Ignored,"J&J's stock fell steeply following its share exchange offer for Kenvue stock, but dip buyers have since returned, auguring well for a further recovery. JNJ's best-in-class """"A+"""" profitability grade provides robust support in a high-interest rate environment. Its renewed focus on its pharma and medtech business provides further valuation support. Management remains open to accretive M&A opportunities, bolstered by a robust balance sheet, which could lift its growth drivers further. I argue why J&J Bulls, who missed buying its previous steep pullbacks, shouldn't miss loading up at the current levels. JNJ looks well-primed to regain control of its uptrend bias."
4640674,2023-10-13,Johnson & Johnson Q3 Earnings Preview: Don't Count On Different Proposition Post Kenvue Spin-Out,"Johnson & Johnson will announce its Q3 earnings on October 17th, with analysts expecting total revenues of $21bn. JNJ recently completed the spinout of its consumer health division, Kenvue, to focus on higher-margin drug development. J&J faces challenges in its pharmaceutical division, including the patent expiry of its best-selling asset, Stelara. Litigation is another major issue for the company - I would not be surprised to see an earnings miss followed by a selloff."
4640209,2023-10-16,Johnson & Johnson: A Conservative High-Yield Dividend Aristocrat Buy,"Johnson & Johnson is a defensive pick with a renewed focus on its pharmaceutical and medtech segments. The recent selloff in the stock has brought its valuation down to undervalued levels. Johnson & Johnson offers a safe 3.0% dividend yield and can provide peace of mind in challenging market conditions. This is the ultimate Ultra SWAN for any recession courtesy of its AAA credit rating, recession-resistant business model, 60-year dividend growth streak, and a super low 15% volatility, lower than almost any individual company (and the S&P 500). Johnson & Johnson is growing around 5% and yields a very safe 3%, so long-term returns of 8% are reasonable to expect. However, a modest 15% discount means that for the next few years, you could beat the S&P but with lower volatility and almost twice the much safer yield."

JNJ maintains a rock-solid balance sheet, which operationally shields it from the higher for longer rate narrative. The stock is currently valued at a 17% discount to fair value.

The company's Q3 results showed solid growth, and it raised its full-year outlook, projecting a 13% year-over-year growth in EPS. JNJ offers a solid 3% dividend yield backed by a 61-year track record. Its AAA balance sheet rating and 46% payout ratio ensure strong safety and reliability. The stock's current blended P/E stands at 16.2x, under the 20-year average of 17.7x, signaling a discount and offering a margin of safety.

ADCs have become a popular investment for big pharma companies, with Pfizer, AbbVie, Merck and others making significant investments into the space. Ambrx's portfolio includes ADCs targeting prostate cancer, breast cancer, and renal cell carcinoma, with its lead candidate, ARX517, showing promising results in prostate cancer patients. Johnson & Johnson has targeted $57bn of revenues from its pharmaceuticals division even as >$10bn p.a. asset Stelara loses patent protection.

I'm more skeptical of management's growth targets in MedTech, as I feel the company has often come up short versus rivals when it comes to disruptive innovation. Long-term revenue growth around 5%, EBITDA margins moving toward 40%, and mid-to-high-20%s FCF margins can support a fair value in the $160-$180 range."
4702262,2024-07-03,Johnson & Johnson: Put Selling Can Yield A Potential 9.8% Return,"Johnson & Johnson's underlying business has a stable long-term outlook and the stock has a low volatility profile, which makes it an ideal platform for selling put options. The company is trading at a highly attractive valuation, which provides a solid margin of error. Selling put options does sacrifice capital appreciation, but with a nearly 10% annualized yield on offer, this opportunity appears to be a win-win to us. We're upgrading JNJ stock to 'Buy'."
4702838,2024-07-08,Johnson & Johnson: Remaining A Buy Despite Remaining Risks,"Johnson & Johnson reported solid first quarter results and is also expecting mid-single digit growth for the full year. The company is facing risks right now, especially from the litigations due to the talc products, and breaking the support line is also a rather bearish sign. But the stock seems slightly undervalued at this point, and Johnson & Johnson is probably a good investment for investors seeking stability and a bond-like investment."
4703489,2024-07-11,Johnson & Johnson Q2 Earnings Preview: Scrutinizing Its Earnings Quality,"Johnson & Johnson will announce its Q2 2024 results on Wednesday, July 17 before the market opens. In this update, I share what to expect from JNJ's Q2 results and put previous results into perspective. In the main part of the article, I will take a close look at JNJ's earnings adjustments, amid the significant deviation from GAAP earnings (+46% median since 2014). I discuss what I believe may be inappropriate earnings adjustments related to JNJ's COVID-19 vaccine and restructuring costs. I also point out an important metric in connection with JNJ's somewhat weak pipeline at the moment."

4705518,2024-07-22,Johnson & Johnson: Seriously Undervalued At Peak Pessimism,"Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceutical giant with a 3.21% dividend yield, released financial results for Q2 2024 that exceeded my expectations. Its oncology franchise revenue was $5.09 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of 15.7% year-on-year. For example, sales of Darzalex, an anticancer medication, were $2.88 billion in the second quarter of 2024, up 18.4% year-on-year. Additionally, thanks to strong sales of the immunology franchise, as well as the acquisition of Shockwave Medical, Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year 2024 operating sales guidance. As a result, I continue to cover Johnson & Johnson with a 'Strong Buy' rating."
4705772,2024-07-23,4 Positives For Johnson & Johnson,"Johnson & Johnson might be the worst performing big pharma stock YTD, but there's upside possible for it in the remainder of 2024. Revenue growth guidance was upgraded and even with a downgrade in EPS guidance, the number is still expected to see a YoY increase. Its market multiples indicate the possibility of some uptick, and there are dividends to consider too. JNJ isn't without its risk, due to Stelara's patent expirations and litigation against it, but for now, it's a safer stock than not."
4716497,2024-08-22,Johnson & Johnson: Don't Bet Against Double Compounding,"JNJ bulls often praise its dividends - rightfully. However, the above-average yield and remarkable dividend record understate the attractiveness. Investors should focus on total shareholder returns, which include dividends but also other factors such as EPS growth and buybacks. Compounding works on a multiplicative basis, not additively. As a result, JNJ's overall return potential is far greater than the simple sum of these factors."
4716746,2024-08-23,Johnson & Johnson: The Dividend King Is Back,
4720963,2024-09-13,Johnson & Johnson: A Strategic MedTech Shift For This Dividend King,"Ongoing lawsuits have presented the opportunity. It is up to the investor to decide just how much risk this adds to the thesis. Post Kenvue spin, the company is deciding to use cash to further diversify their MedTech offerings. The great thing about MedTech versus increasing investment in Medicines is that they don't face the same """"patent cliff"""" issues. V-Wave, Shockwave, and Abiomed account for $30.3 Billion of the $40.4 Billion invested in acquisitions since 2020. That's 75% of the acquisition total in the last 4 years."
4722737,2024-09-23,Johnson & Johnson: A Sell-Rated Dividend King,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is showing signs of a topping pattern with negative divergences in momentum indicators, suggesting potential price weakness ahead. The stock is expensive based on forward P/E and free cash flow yield, with poor growth prospects and negative earnings revisions. Despite favorable seasonality, JNJ may underperform in a risk-on market environment as defensive sectors lag. The dividend yield is attractive, but overall, JNJ is a sell due to limited growth and high valuation."
4722848,2024-09-24,Johnson & Johnson: Wait For More Clarity (Rating Downgrade),
4726000,2024-10-10,Johnson & Johnson: You Need To Look At This Chart (Rating Upgrade),JNJ's current dividend yield is around the highest level in at least 10 years. The market’s concern over its current issues - which are all temporary in my view - is drastically overblown. The overreaction has created a severe mispricing for this sector leader with superb financial strength and stable growth outlook.
4726295,2024-10-11,Johnson & Johnson Q3 Earnings Preview: Dividend Dependability And Steady Growth,"Johnson & Johnson’s Q3 2024 earnings report will highlight its MedTech division, driven by strategic acquisitions and R&D investments in cardiovascular and orthopedic solutions. Despite lagging behind the S&P in price growth, JNJ offers a solid income investment with a 3.09% dividend yield and steady financials. Risks include short-term costs from acquisitions, supply chain issues in the Vision division, and external pressures like currency fluctuations and competition. JNJ is a 'Hold' due to its dependable dividends and strong MedTech growth, but short-term challenges and slight overvaluation suggest caution for new investors."
4726852,2024-10-15,Johnson & Johnson Q3: Strengthening Cardiovascular Device Portfolio,"I reiterate a “Buy” rating for Johnson & Johnson, driven by their robust cardiovascular device portfolio and recent acquisitions, with a fair value of $195 per share. The acquisition of V-Wave enhances Johnson & Johnson's MedTech business, opening new opportunities in the high-growth heart failure device market. Johnson & Johnson's Q3 results exceeded expectations, with 26.5% year-over-year growth in the cardiovascular market and a 5.4% adjusted operational revenue growth. Despite headwinds in China, Johnson & Johnson's decentralization strategy and ongoing acquisitions are expected to drive organic revenue growth and margin expansion."
4727419,2024-10-17,Johnson & Johnson Q3 Earnings Review: Nicely Poised For Steady Growth (Upgrade),"Johnson & Johnson reported solid Q3 revenues of $22.5bn, up 5.2% YoY, despite a 34% drop in EPS due to IPRD and litigation impacts. The innovative medicines division, led by Darzalex and Tremfya, shows strong growth potential, with management expecting revenues to exceed $57bn in 2025. MedTech division saw a 6.4% operational revenue growth, driven by cardiovascular acquisitions, aligning with the company's focus on high innovation, high-growth markets. With a potential resolution to talc litigation and a robust pipeline, JNJ stock is upgraded to “Buy,” offering a 3% dividend yield and substantial long-term growth."
4727827,2024-10-19,Johnson & Johnson: Q3 Earnings Highlights Resilience And New Growth,"J&J's Q3 2024 earnings beat expectations with $22.5B in revenue, driven by strong performances from Darzalex, STELARA, and MedTech, despite ongoing challenges.
         The company updated its full-year guidance, showing optimism despite headwinds like talc litigation and STELARA generic competition, maintaining strong cash flow and dividend payouts.
         New growth opportunities in oncology and MedTech segments, along with strategic acquisitions, are expected to offset potential declines in STELARA sales due to generics.
         I plan to add to my JNJ position if the stock drops below $163, considering technical indicators and potential resistance levels in the near term."
4736848,2024-11-13,Johnson & Johnson: Tracking Well Above The Industry,"In the second half of 2024, Johnson & Johnson made significant progress in developing its oncology franchise. So, Darzalex sales were $3.02 billion in the third quarter of 2024, up 20.7% year-on-year, thanks in part to its label expansions. Moreover, on November 8, 2024, the company announced the filing of regulatory applications to the FDA and EMA seeking approval of Darzalex Faspro for the treatment of high-risk smoldering MM. In addition, thanks in part to growing demand for the immunology star Tremfya, it raised its full-year 2024 operational sales guidance. As a result, Icontinue to cover Johnson & Johnson with a 'Buy' rating."

The company from the Pharmaceuticals Industry, which has an Aaa credit rating from Moody’s, can serve as a strategically important core-position within your dividend portfolio. Allocating the largest proportion of your dividend portfolio to Johnson & Johnson can position your portfolio for reduced volatility and help to decrease its overall risk level. I have selected two ETFs and 10 dividend paying companies for this dividend portfolio, which blends dividend income and dividend growth while offering investors a lowered level of risk."
4742693,2024-12-06,Johnson & Johnson Is A Better Dividend Stock Than Amgen In Our View,"Recent market concerns have pressured the stock prices of both Johnson & Johnson and Amgen Inc. In times of uncertainties, I go back to timeless insights like those offered by Peter Lync on dividend stocks. These insights led me to rate JNJ as a strong buy, a well-rounded package featuring yield, dividend consistency/safety, valuation, and effective inventory management. These insights also led me to downgrade AMGN to hold. It is a solid stock in its own right but falls short on several fronts when compared to JNJ."
4745229,2024-12-19,Johnson & Johnson: Dividend Legend At A Discount,"Johnson & Johnson's diversified revenue streams, significant presence in oncology and immunotherapy, and aggressive growth investments make it a strong defensive play. The company's low leverage, ample liquidity, and impressive free cash flow margin support its dividend sustainability and long-term growth. The stock is very attractively valued with an 18% potential upside."
4748184,2025-01-07,Johnson & Johnson: A Potential Beneficiary Of A Great Rotation,"Johnson & Johnson's stagnant price and bond-like behavior make it an income investment, but a market shift could boost its appeal in 2025. Value stocks, including JNJ, may gain favor as growth stocks' earnings slow and proposed policies boost earnings in other sectors. JNJ's 3.41% dividend yield and attractive forward PE ratio of 13.5 offer potential upside if value stocks regain market attention. While speculative, buying JNJ now at a good valuation with a high dividend yield presents a favorable risk-reward balance."
4747952,2025-01-07,Johnson & Johnson: I'm Saying Yes To This Mess,"JNJ's long-term buy rating is based on its blue-chip pedigree, profitability, and diverse revenue lines, despite recent price stagnation and litigation risks. I emphasize adapting to market conditions, focusing on undervalued blue chips like JNJ, and using option strategies to manage risk and enhance returns. Technical analysis indicates JNJ has downside risk but potential for long-term trading range, making it suitable for a collar strategy. My investment approach prioritizes managing risk with quality large-cap stocks, aiming to capitalize on market neglect and long-term potential."
4748338,2025-01-08,Dividend Roundup: Why I Prefer Johnson & Johnson Over Pfizer,"The latest dividend declarations, combined with stock price movements, have pushed PFE’s yield to be almost twice as JNJ’s. But I want to caution you to look beyond yield (and P/E too) and examine other aspects, especially those often overlooked by dividend investors. JNJ offers better growth, a stronger track record, and also a safer payout. JNJ's stable inventory management and ongoing share repurchases further solidify its position as a better dividend stock than PFE."

4749127,2025-01-13,What Johnson & Johnson Is Getting With The Acquisition Of Intra-Cellular Therapies,"Johnson & Johnson is acquiring Intra-Cellular Therapies for $14.6 billion or $132 per share. Caplyta's peak sales potential exceeds $5 billion in the hands of J&J, driven by growth in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and the pending approval in major depressive disorder. The deal also brings Intra-Cellular Therapies' early-stage pipeline that adds to the long-term upside potential of the deal. Intellectual property risk on Caplyta is substantially reduced with last week's settlement with Sandoz, but not entirely eliminated as it does not stop other generic manufacturers from trying. I believe J&J is paying (at least) a fair price, with decent likelihood of creating substantial long-term value for the company."
4749953,2025-01-16,Johnson & Johnson: Q4 Earnings May Not Prompt Sustained Directional Moves,"Johnson & Johnson has underperformed its large-cap healthcare peers and the S&P 500, with an -8% decline over the past year. Even though JNJ has displayed an improving track record of beating consensus EPS, the Q4 earnings event, due to be held on the 22nd of Jan., may not significantly boost the stock. Question marks over the rising debt driven by M&A, the uncertainty surrounding the talcum powder lawsuits, slowing dividend growth, and potentially lower FY25 EPS guidance may weigh heavily. Despite some challenges, JNJ's dividend yield remains attractive, the stock appears to be priced attractively, and the risk-reward on the charts looks encouraging."

So, sales of its oncology franchise reached $5.5 billion, an increase of 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Moreover, Johnson & Johnson expects its operational sales to grow by 2% to 3% in 2025, while its adjusted diluted EPS will be between $10.50 and $10.70, implying single-digit percentage growth.

Overall, JNJ showed more pronounced unevenness in its Q4 results, while ABBV’s growth story is pretty clear-cut. The goal of this article is to analyze their updates through Graham’s framework for picking defensive stocks. This framework helps to filter out short-term fluctuations and show JNJ is a better defensive stock than ABBV despite mixed Q4 results."
4764871,2025-03-05,"Johnson & Johnson: No More Tears, Just Gains In Intra-Cellular Acquisition","Intra-Cellular Therapies' Caplyta shows strong sales growth and label expansion potential, making it a valuable acquisition for Johnson & Johnson at $14 billion. JNJ's acquisition of ITCI is strategic, replacing its aging Invega with Caplyta, which has patent protection until 2033 and ongoing clinical trials for new formulations. The $14 billion price tag is justified given Caplyta's advanced clinical stage, FDA approvals, and potential blockbuster status in the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder markets. Schizophrenia and MDD markets are substantial, with Caplyta positioned to capture significant market share, enhancing JNJ's portfolio amidst broader portfolio challenges."

4767996,2025-03-16,Kenvue + Johnson & Johnson: I Choose To Own The Whole 'Humpty Dumpty',"Johnson & Johnson's spin-off of Kenvue has created two resilient defensive stocks in the healthcare sector, ideal for accumulation during market volatility. Despite being off their highs, both JNJ and Kenvue present attractive buying opportunities due to their low betas and relatively high dividends. These are exactly the resilient defensive stocks in an un-loved healthcare sector that investors are now piling into as the VIX spikes. Rebuilding a balanced portfolio by investing 90%  in JNJ and 10% Kenvue can capture the blended resiliency of the original company."
4771410,2025-03-28,Johnson & Johnson Needs Time To Consolidate (Technical Analysis And Downgrade),"Two recent catalysts, one technical and one fundamental, have promoted me to adjust my rating on JNJ to a HOLD from my earlier buy rating. Technical trading patterns signal that JNJ is entering a consolidation phase with no clear directional momentum in the near term. In the meantime, JNJ's valuation ratios have expanded, narrowing the discount compared to historical averages and shifting its return/risk profile. On the positive side, long-term prospects are promising due to strong drug pipeline developments and significant R&D investments. The current dividend yield is also above historical average."
4774546,2025-04-11,"Johnson & Johnson: Fairly Valued, But Recession-Resilient","Johnson & Johnson offers stability and limited downside risk, making it a solid investment in volatile markets, despite not being a high-growth stock. The company's fiscal 2024 results showed moderate growth in sales and earnings, with notable performance in the oncology and cardiovascular segments. Analysts expect low-to-mid single-digit growth for Johnson & Johnson, with a focus on operational efficiency and share buybacks to boost the bottom line. Valuation metrics suggest Johnson & Johnson is fairly valued, with an intrinsic value estimate of $168.39, making it a reasonable investment in uncertain times."

The MedTech division grew 4.1%, driven by acquisitions, while Pharmaceuticals saw a 4.2% increase, despite challenges like Stelara's patent expiry. JNJ raised its full-year revenue guidance and increased its dividend, reflecting confidence in long-term growth despite short-term litigation and tariff uncertainties. JNJ stock remains a """"sensible"""" pharma investment with solid performance, diversified revenue streams, and manageable debt, though litigation remains a significant concern."
4777511,2025-04-24,Johnson & Johnson Just Proved The Bears Wrong Again,"Johnson & Johnson has started 2025 better than I expected, even with the long-running talc saga. It beat the consensus estimates again by a wide margin, thanks to its leading positions in the oncology and immunology market. So, sales of Tremfya amounted to $956 million, and Darzalex reached $3.24 billion in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 18.3% and 20.2% year-on-year, respectively.

I expect continued market volatility in the negotiation process. Johnson & Johnson could offer some immunity due to the specific breakdown of the trade between these two countries and JNJ’s relatively minor exposure to China. Additionally, the dividend yield of 3.4%, is among the highest levels in at least 10 years."
