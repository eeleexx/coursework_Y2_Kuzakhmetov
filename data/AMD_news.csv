4237167,2019-01-31,AMD: No Hangover After All?,"AMD reported Q4 financial results mostly in-line with expectations. The company managed to successfully withstand the crypto hangover and datacenter segment's oversaturation, in contrast to Nvidia and Intel. While the guidance was revised slightly to lower numbers, the overall expectations are relatively positive, especially compared to other companies. My price target for AMD stock remains at the level of $30 by the end of 2019."
4237130,2019-01-31,I Expect AMD To Rally,"The post-earnings gap on AMD looks ambiguous; it could be an area gap, but my analysis hints at a breakaway gap. AMD's cognitive dissonance profile shows its investors to be highly optimistic, dampening selloffs while exacerbating rallies. A lexical analysis on the recent earnings call justifies a long position in AMD."
4237575,2019-02-01,AMD: The Growing Bubble,"AMD reported sub-par earnings for Q4 2018. Shares rallied significantly despite the meager results. If current trajectory continues, the stock is likely headed for a cliff."
4237942,2019-02-04,AMD: Expecting Upside,AMD gave a weak Q1 guide. 2019's guide was OK. It may have been better than most. But we'll show that what they said may hint to more.
4237912,2019-02-04,Covered-Call Writing With AMD: My February Trade Setups,"Covered-call writing is one of my favorite strategies to generate monthly income while lowering my cost basis and mitigating downside risk. Due to elevated implied volatility, AMD's options chain generate compelling time value returns following the reaction on its latest earnings report. In this article, I'll discuss a defensive (in the money call) and a more aggressive (out of the money call) setup."
4237871,2019-02-04,AMD: EPYC'ly Setting The Bar,
4238190,2019-02-05,AMD: Share Gain Story,
4238574,2019-02-06,AMD: Good News And Bad,Major holder updates investors on its position. My thoughts on the recent earnings report. Looking for clarity on cash uses.
4239836,2019-02-11,AMD Underreacts (To Guidance),
4241483,2019-02-15,AMD: Closing The Gap (The Best Is Yet To Come),AMD will close the gap with Nvidia introducing its GPU code named Navi. A cash infusion of $448.5 million will go a long way funding R&D and/or paying down debt. $805 million of debt will be diluted away shortly.
4241845,2019-02-18,Meridian Contrarian Fund Q4 2018 Commentary,"Meridian funds have been investing for their shareholders with an eye toward the long term. ArrowMark Colorado Holdings serves as the investment adviser to the Meridian Funds and brings a management team with decades of experience in both traditional and alternative investment management. Includes detailed analysis of Meridian Contrarian Fund's positions in NKTR, AMD, GPK, NEM, MLNX, and BNFT. The Meridian Contrarian Fund (the “Fund”) returned -18.70% (net) for the quarter, underperforming its benchmark, the Russell 2500 Index, which returned -18.49%."
4242495,2019-02-20,AMD's Stock May Jump On Higher GPU Prices,"AMD's options have seen some bullish betting in recent days. The technical charts are pointing to a potential breakout. GPU prices have been on the rise, suggesting inventories may be thinning out."
4242524,2019-02-20,AMD: Blockchain Rebound,"AMD revenues were hit hard in 2018 by the sharp declines in blockchain-related revenues. Surging cryptocurrency prices have the potential of reigniting the blockchain market. The company expects 13%-plus revenue growth in 2019, ex-blockchain. A blockchain tailwind would provide another path for achieving my 2020 targets of $10 billion revenues and $1.50 EPS."
4242505,2019-02-20,My Final AMD Article - I Was Wrong,
4242682,2019-02-21,AMD: The Big Guys Just Love It,"Most of AMD's largest institutional investors increased positions in the chipmaker in the last reporting cycle. Analysts, too, seem to be bullish on the chipmaker. They've gradually raised their EPS targets for the chipmaker over the past 90 days. I would recommend readers and investors to ignore the noise and consider accumulating shares of AMD."
4244084,2019-02-25,AMD's Long-Term Target Prices,"Street analysts have been very optimistic about AMD’s long-term fundamentals, assuming China uncertainty, crypto weakness, and the Fed’s tight interest rate policy will become headwinds blown over by 2H 2019. Wall Street’s wisdom expects that AMD’s Ryzen and EPYC chips will continue to be the key drivers for sales growth. AMD’s strategy of regaining CPU market share through lower-end server CPUs has paid off at the expense of a structurally lower margin than Nvidia and Intel. Invading into Intel’s dominated high-end corporate IT server space and data center allows AMD to expand its margin in the low 40%'s by early 2020. Based on the optimistic forecast fundamentals, AMD’s longer-term stock price path can be sketched out to hit $33 one year out and $38 by 2021."
4244870,2019-02-27,AMD: Upside Momentum Ahead,"AMD's success in obtaining data center market share with EPYC has led to high expectations for EPYC 2, likely to hit the market this quarter or next. Product release hype often fuels short-term rallies in AMD, as per my analysis of stock price reactions after novel information hits the market. In addition, AMD has rallied 26% since earnings, and this rally has produced what appears to be sustainable upward momentum. The recent up gap in AMD is likely a breakaway gap and bolstered by other technical as well as fundamental catalysts - options can help you leverage the breakaway gap."
4247478,2019-03-08,How Much Market Share AMD Needs To Be A $30 Stock,"AMD’s share price has been moving as if there is a zero-sum gain between Intel and AMD’s CPU market share. Historically, AMD stock price changes have been more related to market share changes than to revenue changes. Aided by EPYC Naples and incoming Rome, AMD server market share has reached to 3.2% in 4Q 2018 and looks to “take 3 generations to gain server market shares.”. With a current PC total revenue market share at 8.5%, the Street’s consensus estimates predict that AMD’s market share may reach 10% in late 2020. For every 1% gain in total market share, AMD share price will increase by $0.66. For AMD to reach $30 a share, its market share has to increase to 20%."
4247790,2019-03-11,Intel Vs. AMD: Battle For Market Share,"2018 was a great year for both Intel and AMD, particularly in the CPU market. AMD's top-line increased 23% as they gained market share from Intel, while Intel themselves managed a 13% revenue increase by inflating their CPU prices on the market. My forecast of the CPU market share between these two rivals for the next 4 years indicates their monopoly of the market may be ending. I identified a significant threat to the traditional x86 CPU market in the rise of ARM-based processors which are rapidly creeping into the market."
4248145,2019-03-12,Advanced Micro Devices: The Better Data Center Play,Nvidia bought Mellanox for premium to advanced high-performance computing in data centers. AMD trades very favorably compared to Mellanox at the buyout price of $125 per share. The overlooked AMD story is vast gross margin improvements from sector low levels of 40% to industry norms above 60%.
4249263,2019-03-16,AMD: Advanced Mass Delusions,Advanced Micro Devices continues to ride on all hope without delivering an iota of results. The price increase alongside weakening backdrop going into results presents another compelling shorting opportunity. We break down what we expect and why this short can be a great hedge to your portfolio.
4250237,2019-03-21,AMD's Stock May Go Significantly Higher,AMD is breaking out based on the technical chart. Volatility for the stock will continue to be elevated. Options betting suggests the stock can continue to rise as well.
4250200,2019-03-21,AMD Shorts: A Mass Exodus,"Short interest in AMD has been steadily declining for many months now. The company isn't heavily shorted, at least not when compared to some other names within the semiconductors space. The chipmaker may still be faced by challenges but it seems to have multiple growth catalysts that can bolster its growth over the years to come."
4251535,2019-03-28,Advanced Micro Devices And Google Stadia: When Reality Sets In,"AMD shares surged over 20% on the news of Google using custom graphics chipset from AMD in its upcoming Stadia online gaming. The news initially didn't move the needle for Google, but the hype caught up with Google the following day as well. Google will be the latecomer competing against incumbents with years of gaming experience. Even if wildly successful, this endeavor may end up being severely cannibalistic for AMD."
4252631,2019-04-03,AMD: Where Can This Thing Go?,"We recently wrote that we thought AMD was being too conservative. Data coming out may confirm they were way too conservative. But nobody's looking at 2020 yet. We are, and wow."
4253319,2019-04-08,AMD Vs. Google: CPUs Vs. Streaming,AMD is not the choice CPU for Google's Stadia - this was (erroneously) taken as bad news in the market. Serious gamers - those willing to spend their hard-earning cash on CPU-heavy products - are not taking Stadia seriously. Pre-earnings drift implies excess returns of 2% for investor buying one month ahead of earnings.
4253285,2019-04-08,Crash Protection For AMD,"Shares of AMD have rocketed 74% since the market's December low. In the event they come tumbling back down to earth, I present two ways AMD shareholders can stay long while locking in some gains. I also note why my site is a bit more bullish on Intel than AMD currently."
4253649,2019-04-09,AMD: The ABCs Of A Better 2H 2019,"AMD’s market and financial data give three clues why there will be a better 2H 2019. AMD stock price jumped despite unfavorable Q1 and Q2 revenue estimates but with an upward revision on the Q3 revenue estimate, ignoring the present but focusing on the future. AMD stock rallied amid subsequent simultaneous upward revisions of Q1, Q2, and Q3 revenue estimates. This is a classic Dow’s Confirmation Theory, signaling a reversal in sight. A declining finished goods and work in progress inventory and a rising raw material inventory suggest that both product market and management forecast improve into 2H 2019. Aside from a different issue whether the positive outlook has been baked into stock prices, we are confident that a better 2H 2019 is real for AMD."
4253641,2019-04-09,AMD: Untold Margin Story,AMD takes a hit from $30 despite a bullish analyst call with a $35 target. Most analysts continue to under estimate the gross margin upside for the chip company. The 2020 base case is the average analyst estimates for $8.25 billion in revenues and $1 EPS. The EPS upside is $2-plus based on higher margins from market share gains.
4254705,2019-04-16,Why Computex Is A Positive Catalyst For AMD's Stock,AMD is widely expected to announce a new Ryzen chip. Mid-range Navi GPU refresh expected. Revenue growth prospects improve after product announcements at Computex.
4255083,2019-04-18,AMD Earnings: Brace For Impact,"AMD reports its first quarter earnings in two weeks. Investors should closely monitor AMD's shipment and ASP trends, the magnitude of its OEM design wins and its server market share gains in its Q1. The analyst consensus and management's guidance are coinciding, which suggests that neither of the two is going overboard with their estimates."
4255815,2019-04-22,AMD Bonds Are Too Expensive,"Even with their disappointing Q4 financials, AMD’s stock has still managed to advance more than 50% in 2019. Many argue that AMD stock is overvalued. As AMD’s B+ rated junk bond prices correlate with AMD stock prices, the mispricing of their bonds, if any, may give clues about AMD stock’s mispricing. AMD 7% 2024 bond yield is 100 basis points lower than the comparable, so the bond is 5% overvalued. 5% bond mispricing is significant, considering AMD's annual bond yield is around 6%. More importantly, AMD junk bond overvaluation may suggest AMD stock's overvaluation."
4255990,2019-04-23,Nvidia Vs. Xilinx: Heavy Hitter AI Stocks,"The size of this AI and ML economy is expected to reach $15 trillion by 2030, up from $2 trillion this year. We are in the critical years where startups must quickly design and develop AI if they want first-mover advantage. This is creating a battle between FPGAs and GPUs. Nvidia is one of my favorite companies from a fundamental standpoint and Xilinx also makes a solid investment if/when you can secure the right entry point."
4257149,2019-04-26,Xilinx: What Happens When One Of Our Picks Falls Off A Cliff,"Xilinx was one of the top ten Portfolio Armor names I shared with Marketplace subscribers on April 18th. It's down 14.78% since, after its profit miss and downgrade this week. Here, I show how the Xilinx hedge in our top names portfolio from April 18th ameliorated that drop. I also address the question of how good my security selection process is, given its miss with Xilinx so far."
4257704,2019-04-29,AMD's Stock May Jump Following Results,AMD may surge following its earnings results on Tuesday. The stock may rise as high as $31.40 following results. The chart and the option point to higher prices.
4257679,2019-04-29,AMD Q1 Earnings: It's All About The Second Half,"Without any positive material information, AMD’s share price has already increased more than 40% from an obviously negative Q4 earnings report. Bulls may have bought in to management’s wishful thinking of a better second half of 2019. The market may have reacted to a friendlier macro environment. For 2H 2019, AMD’s CPU revenue is expected to increase if China's gaming weakness improves. The server market share may increase if cloud-spending cuts improve. AMD’s GPU market share gain may be slowed by Nvidia's Turing launch, their presence in PC GPUs and the AI training. While 3% of AMD’s “air” in share prices has been taken out by Intel's Q1 earnings, the post-earnings price move should largely depend on Dr. Su’s Q3 and Q4 guidance."
4257983,2019-04-30,AMD: Halftime Report,"After the success of a hedged portfolio built around an AT&T position in 2017, I started presenting similar portfolios built around other stocks, including AMD in January. Here, I update the performance of the AMD portfolio halfway through its planned six-month duration. This portfolio is up 6.41% so far, lagging both its components (unhedged) and SPY. I explain why."
4259208,2019-05-02,Xilinx: Looking Beyond The Earnings Report,
4259039,2019-05-02,AMD: Curious Earnings Reversal,"Shares lose gains despite solid report. Was this a market thing or something else? After warrant exercise, balance sheet stronger."
4262671,2019-05-10,AMD: Get On The Hype Train - And Ride,"This quarter was a mixed bag of results. Q3, however, is going to be an epic choo-choo train of hype - brace yourself. How we are playing the hype."
4264896,2019-05-17,AMD May Be Eating Nvidia's Lunch,"Nvidia reported weak data center revenue. AMD's data center appears to be strong. AMD's stock may be heading higher, while Nvidia's heads lower."
4265099,2019-05-19,AMD: Mid-Year Update - Incredibly Strong Performer,"AMD has gone up 50% since I last updated on the investment. The company has done incredibly well since early 2018, when I first recommended it. The company is continuing down its path of innovation and plans to release its next-generation products soon. This should cement the company's lead, especially in CPUs. I recommend investing in AMD for the long-term. The company should continue to reward shareholders well."
4265254,2019-05-20,AMD: David And Goliath All Over Again,"AMD shares are up a staggering 48% YTD, and 134% Y/Y. The fun might just be getting started. The story of AMD is a repeat of David and Goliath. Except this time, AMD is going after two Goliaths, and is winning. AMD's server roadmap, particularly within CPUs, is quite interesting as it taps into a $25 billion addressable market where Intel is the sole provider of solutions. AMD is set to expand significantly over the coming years, and take significant business from Nvidia and Intel. Despite all my optimism on the business's fundamentals, it is difficult to wrap my head around AMD's valuation. Initiating at HOLD, $28 PT."
4266875,2019-05-28,Make AMD Great Again,AMD is done giving up GPU market share to Nvidia. MAGA (Make AMD Great Again) is in full force with the impending release of the Navi GPU. Additional catalysts are in the works to keep the PR on AMD high and (hopefully with that) various trading opportunities.
4266800,2019-05-28,AMD's Stock Is Breaking Out Of Its Slumber,AMD may rise to as high as $31.40 based on the technical chart. The options are also suggesting the stock rises by July. There is evidence that indicates AMD may be taking market shares from Nvidia and Intel.
4267165,2019-05-29,AMD: 7 Reasons To Hop Off This Hype Train,"AMD has been one of the best performing large-cap stocks up 115% over the past year. Investors are focusing on an innovative product pipeline expected to take market share from rivals, while valuation appears exuberant. A number of bearish macro themes, including weakness in the global chip industry, slowing PC market, amid demand uncertainty, should be discounted in the stock price outweighing current momentum. 5G-powered low-latency cloud-based gaming could disrupt the PC and console GPU market over next decade, threatening AMD's model."
4267110,2019-05-29,AMD: Valuation On 35x Forward P/E,"Compared with Intel and Nvidia, AMD recent share price has been largely unmoved by the macro picture and industry-specific factors. It appears that the market has priced in AMD’s ability to steal Intel’s CPU and Nvidia’s GPU market share with EPYC growth, the launches of 7nm products and Navi. Using a revenue perspective, AMD’s fair value should be between $26 and $32. AMD is undervalued by 5%-10%. Using an earnings perspective, AMD’s fair value should be between $21 and $24.  AMD is overvalued by 15%-20%. The fact that AMD currently trades closer to the revenue-based fair value suggests that investors still value AMD’s market share over its profitability."
4267283,2019-05-30,AMD: Latest Campaign Has Several Targets,"After reaching 50 years of corporate live, AMD has several key """"50"""" targets. A $50 stock would be a new all-time high for that a stock that peaked in 2000. A 50% gross margin would allow the company to smash 2021 EPS estimates of $1.12. The stock is cheap at $26 as the market realizes that gross margins are headed towards 50%+."
4267121,2019-05-30,AMD: Big Investors Are Bulking Up,"Institutions grew more bullish on AMD in the last 13F reporting cycle. The stock is still trading in the same price-range, in which institutions accumulated their shares, so retail investors can still enter AMD and have same cost-basis as the big guys. Readers and investors should consider going long on the stock."
4269203,2019-06-07,AMD: Why We Covered Our Short Position,Being perfectly right on the fundamentals and wrong on price action is no fun. We follow up on our earlier report on Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s earnings expectations. The stock is incredibly expensive for falling earnings. But we still covered our short. We explain why.
4269703,2019-06-11,New Product Launches At E3 Set Advanced Micro Devices Up For A Great Year Ahead,
4269996,2019-06-12,"AMD: Bright Future, Low Margin Of Safety",
4269967,2019-06-12,AMD's Gamble Now Paying Off,"It's great for consumers and businesses to see a truly rejuvenated AMD, because it inevitably forces competitors to get better, which in turn, leads to better products from all the major players, as well as a more dynamic computing market. To be clear, AMD still needs to execute on the broad vision that it has laid out for itself - and unfortunately, execution issues have slowed the company in the past. Still, it's encouraging to see some key strategies driving new opportunities, and it will be interesting to see what AMD is able to do with them as we head into the future."
4271157,2019-06-19,Xilinx Is Poised To Outperform As Rapid Technological Innovation Continues,
4271556,2019-06-21,AMD: Price To Book Shows More Upward Movement Coming,"Book value outpacing the upward trend in share price is a positive sign. Quality and competitive pricing of new products confirm this bullish sign. The market has not yet caught up with the surges in net assets, meaning sharp rises in share price are imminent. AMD is, therefore, a strong buy right now."
4271856,2019-06-24,Lofty And Cyclical AMD Is 'The Big Short',"The stock is an unbelievable short candidate. It combines a lofty price and cyclically favourable conditions that will reverse and turn the company to loss. Long expiration, far out of the money put options are the best way to exploit this overvalued stock. The strategy can also be used as a hedge against a possible coming recession or stock crash."
4272070,2019-06-25,AMD: Forced Out Of China,The China joint venture is kaput. The U.S. government has all but shut down the joint venture. The market has overreacted and this gives us an opportunity. How we are adjusting fire to take advantage of this situation.
4271927,2019-06-25,Xilinx: 5G And The Huawei Ban,"The 5G rollout requires FPGAs, which should benefit Xilinx as the number one supplier of re-programmable integrated circuits. The trade war and the banning of Huawei could offset the benefits Xilinx was set to receive from carriers upgrading to 5G networks. Demand for Xilinx may have been artificially inflated due to Chinese companies stocking up in anticipation of possible sanctions. Standing on the sidelines is the prudent move as long as Xilinx is surrounded by unresolved issues that could pull down forward guidance."
4272299,2019-06-27,AMD: I Like Money,
4272747,2019-06-28,It's Time For AMD To Raise Prices,"AMD has made the choice to use a low ASP strategy to increase unit shipment (market share) at the expense of a lower EPS (profitability). Such strategy has proven successful for AMD to increase stock price, although a lower ASP is usually associated with a lower stock price. For every $1 increase in ASP, AMD stock price increases $0.40. AMD’s ASP has already been raised over the critical level that unit shipment will no longer respond to any further ASP increase. The in-elasticity would suggest a great opportunity for AMD to raise its ASP, without the loss of unit shipment, in order to increase revenue, gross margin, EPS, and ultimately the stock price."
4273345,2019-07-03,AMD: Beyond The Thunderdome,Nvidia rebrands the 2080 into the 2070 Super with a massive price cut that pressures AMD Navi GPUs. The 2080 and the 2060 both get refreshes for speed boosts. AMD has a hard battle lined up in the GPU arena. Nvidia brings the GPU pain to AMD. How we are playing this news.
4274507,2019-07-11,AMD Faces Critical Test,Shares looking to break out and avoid triple top. Growth narrative about to shift in a significant way. Improving balance sheet provides possibilities.
4274490,2019-07-11,AMD's Stock May Reach Prices Not Seen Since 2006,AMD is nearing a potentially big breakout on the chart. Options betting has been bullish recently. The stock may be cheap based on projected earnings growth.
4275238,2019-07-16,Nvidia Should Not Wage A Price War Against AMD,"Nvidia has been historically blessed by its superior GPU product performance. Nvidia has a relatively flat demand curve; units demanded is mainly driven by product performance and less by product pricing. Nvidia has felt the increasing pressure to respond to AMD’s new GPU product roll out at a low ASP. Nvidia’s inelastic demand curve suggests that changing prices will have less impact on market share changes. As Nvidia stock price has been typically more responsive to revenue and EPS, not to market share, it would be an ineffective defense for Nvidia to wage a price war."
4275794,2019-07-18,AMD: Hold It And Relax,"AMD is overvalued right now, but it doesn't matter in the long run. It could deliver a 30% annual growth. The current line of products couldn't be better."
4277111,2019-07-24,AMD: Critical Time Approaches,"AMD will be reporting its Q2 earnings on July 30. Investors should pay close attention to its ASP and shipment growth numbers and its management's Q3 guidance in addition to tracking its sales figure for Q2. It's still a good time to be bullish on AMD, but I would recommend investors to remain vigilant to ensure it's actually making progress."
4279868,2019-07-31,AMD Dents Some Growth Hopes,"Q2 revenues slightly beat, but non-GAAP EPS just in-line.
         Q3 revenue guidance disappoints, yearly forecast reduced.
         Stock breakout not likely to happen without outside help."
4279603,2019-07-31,AMD Portfolio: Final Performance,"In January, I presented a hedged portfolio built around a position in Enbridge, designed for conservative investors unwilling to risk a decline of more than 12%. These portfolios last six months, so here I update this one's final performance. This portfolio returned 13.19% over six months, net of hedging and trading costs. This exceeded the 8.25% expected return for our site estimated for it in January."
4280117,2019-08-01,"AMD: Solid Earnings And Credible Google Rumors, Time To Buy","AMD slightly beat revenues, which increased 20% QoQ. Q3 guidance sees both YoY and QoQ increases in revenues. Credible rumors reveal that AMD is likely about to steal Google as a client from Intel. Panic selling after hours upon the earnings release was clearly unwarranted. Take advantage of the cheap shares and buy them aggressively before dumb money regains some perspective."
4280093,2019-08-01,Government Policy Affects Xilinx,"Xilinx beat earnings and posted record revenues, but revised forward guidance gives reason to be concerned. Xilinx acknowledges Huawei’s impact, but Victor Peng believes that the fallout will be contained due to a number of reasons. If Victor Peng’s assumptions turn out to be wrong, Xilinx could stand to lose a lot more than it currently believes is possible. Standing on the sidelines is best when the stock has gained as much as it has and there is much in need of clarity."
4280759,2019-08-02,AMD: Unwarranted Panic Selling On Irrelevant Trump Tweet,
4281750,2019-08-05,AMD: Primed And Ready,AMD takes another hit due to more market headwinds related to the game console market. The company is forecasted to reach annualized revenues of $8.35 billion by Q3'20. AMD is forecasted to reach 43% gross margins in Q3 and is on the path to 50% gross margins. The stock has reasonable targets of $10 billion in revenues and a $1.75 EPS.
4281668,2019-08-05,AMD: Sidelines,There were a couple of issues with AMD's report. Namely AMD had a weak guide but needs a huge Q4 turnaround. We move to the sidelines. I'll explain.
4283281,2019-08-08,AMD: The Upgrades Are Coming,"AMD just snagged Google and Twitter as clients with the launch of its EPYC Rome processor. The Q2 earnings transcript suggests that the Q3 guidance did not factor in Google and Twitter, meaning a positive Q3 surprise is likely. Since Google and Twitter are onboard with AMD's superior product, it's likely that other Intel clients will follow suit. The surprise market share growth will probably result in analyst upgrades. We said it twice recently, we'll say it again - buy aggressively."

4285559,2019-08-14,Xilinx: Buy Because AI Will Ramp On Top Of 5G,"Xilinx is in an up cycle based on 5G, despite Huawei woes. AI opportunities favor Xilinx. 2020 should mark an acceleration in revenue and profit."
4285484,2019-08-14,AMD's Is Ready For The GPU War With Nvidia,"AMD has given shareholders a lot of joy in the past. The share price has more than quadrupled in the last three years.
         But there is still the GPU market, where AMD was always behind Nvidia. As in the competition with Intel, this seems to change now.
         Nevertheless, AMD is well on its way to remedying this last weak point in its product portfolio."

4288291,2019-08-27,AMD: Full Value Myth,AMD has taken a performance lead with the release of the Epyc 2 chips. New customers like Twitter and Google provide more confidence for 20% market share in the data center space. AMD doesn't trade at full value at $30. The stock has reasonable targets of $10 billion in revenues and a $1.75 EPS.
4288508,2019-08-28,Why The Market May Be Undervaluing AMD's Potential,"AMD currently undervalued, even by conservative valuation estimates. AMD's new 7nm Zen-2 architecture is far superior to Intel offerings in both PC market and far more lucrative data center market. AMD has secured the games consoles market and now has the technological capability to challenge NVIDIA in the high performance GPU market."

4290670,2019-09-10,The Market Keeps Ignoring How Bad AMD Really Is,"AMD's financial results have been terrible for many years. Investors still believe that """"this time it's different"""" due to late-cycle optimism. AMD stock can still climb higher, but it remains a gamble and not an investment."
4291825,2019-09-16,AMD: The Dead Zone,
4292079,2019-09-17,Intel Vs. AMD: Losing The Battle But Winning The War,"Due to its sheer size, Intel stock price is historically more sensitive to revenue growth than to market share. Intel has a good chance to win the CPU war if 3Q revenue is ready to ramp from a renewed corporate IT budget and the scheduled 10nm launch. In contrast, due to its small market share, AMD’s stock price is more sensitive to market share changes than to revenue growth. AMD’s relative valuation will increase as it will win the battle of market share increase against Intel from its 7nm new product offerings. Relative to AMD, Intel is considerably undervalued, given the expected market share and revenue growth."
4292341,2019-09-18,Xilinx Inc.: Too Much Unwarranted Pessimism,"The market has continued being rather lukewarm on Xilinx ever since the Huawei ban. A leading Wall Street analyst recently downgraded the shares on concerns about FaaS delays. Yet, peering deeper at the company's prospects reveals a business still in the pink of health."
4294824,2019-10-03,AMD's Recent Sell-Off May Be At Its End,The stock has fallen about 12% over the past couple of weeks. The valuation has fallen to the lower end of its historical range. This has led to a number of bullish options bets.
4295092,2019-10-04,Intel And AMD: Computing Power Commoditization,Microsoft has announced new 2-in-1 tablets and laptops. A development from this announcement hasn't been given enough emphasis. This development is the first shot in a race towards commoditization of computing power.
4296012,2019-10-10,AMD Short Interest Jumps Again,Second major short interest jump in two months. Investors seemed bearish heading into Q3 end. Company could use some trade war truce help.
4296614,2019-10-15,Don't Believe Rumors About TSMC Shortages Affecting AMD,"Rumors about AMD not able to get 7nm capacity at TSMC have been denied by AMD and TSMC. TSMC needs AMD to be successful in x86 business in order to meaningfully grow its market share rapidly. Given the strategic imperative, we do not see much chance that AMD will struggle to get capacity."
4297067,2019-10-17,AMD: A Significant Boost From One Segment Awaits In 2020,"AMD has grown its market share in most of the revenue segments, which contributed to the sharp increase in the stock price over the last two years. One particular segment of AMD's revenue, namely semi-custom, has been in decline over recent years due to the cyclical nature of the business. Now, AMD can expect a significant and probably unprecedented boost from the Semi-Custom segment thanks to several design wins. The stock may remain flat in the nearest future, but AMD is attractive for long-term investment at the current levels."
4297948,2019-10-22,Advanced Micro Devices' Turnaround May Be Over,AMD's stock has recovered in recent weeks but that may be about to fade. The company is due to report results on October 29. The chart and the stock suggest shares will fall.
4297960,2019-10-22,AMD's Extremely Successful Price Strategy Could Burden AMD And Intel Investors Long Term,"The launch of the second Epyc CPU generation, powered by AMD's latest ZEN 2 core design, was not so long ago. At the moment, AMD is promoting the price/performance ratio of this Epyc generation. Given that, there is an extremely impressive defeat for Intel. Investors need to look at AMD's operations without bias and ask themselves whether management is really getting every possible USD of profit out of the company. In my opinion, AMD should put the focus a little more away from the penetration strategy, and instead, switch a little more to the skimming strategy."
4298895,2019-10-24,AMD's EPYC Blows Intel's Xeon Out Of The Water,"AMD has released EPYC Rome, its new line of server CPUs. It's apparent that Intel's current lineup of Xeon chips is overmatched. With advantages in price and performance, AMD is already gaining market share at Intel's expense."
4298406,2019-10-24,AMD: It's Go Time,
4299120,2019-10-25,AMD Shares Look To Recover From Trade War Thaw,"Almost tripled in share values during the last two years, AMD may be the last stock you would call a victim of the trade war. Yet, AMD bulls would also tell you that the new 7nm products alone should have quadrupled the share price if it was not for the trade war. AMD’s margin was negatively affected by 1.3% because of the tariff cost. But the loss was more than offset by the higher margins of the new 7nm Ryzen and EYPC. After accounting for the improving financials, there is still a 22% discount currently applied to AMD’s value, which is related to trade war risk. If trade war thaws, AMD share will jump by $7."
4299476,2019-10-27,AMD: Bullish On Earnings,"AMD reports Tuesday after the close. The company gave a big Q4 guide but I think it's doable. The real earnings upside, though, comes in 2020. That can start to drive the stock now."
4300138,2019-10-29,AMD: Not Exactly Impressive,
4299961,2019-10-29,Assessing AMD Before Earnings,AMD had a pre-earnings run due to Intel posting positive earnings. Will the numbers that AMD posts match what the speculators are projecting? Long term AMD is a winner. Short term I'm taking a few chips off the table and letting the rest ride while using puts as insurance.
4299886,2019-10-29,How Huawei And 5G Could Cause More Headwinds For Xilinx,"Xilinx managed to grow revenue and net income in Q2, but Q3 guidance and a slowing trend are cause for concern. Despite the current headwinds, management thinks that Q3 will be the bottom and Q4 will be the start of a recovery. Xilinx is not counting on Huawei for the rest of FY2020, but that does not mean that there’s no more risk for Xilinx. Xilinx will likely have to deal with more trade restrictions as a consequence of a race between the U.S. and China."
4300940,2019-10-31,AMD Earnings: Out Of The Frying Pan And Into The Fire,"AMD reported third quarter earnings after the close Tuesday. While the company reported solid results on the top and bottom lines, the market is expecting more. AMD's fight against Intel will be a marathon, not a race."
4302348,2019-11-04,AMD: Shift Up To The Next Level,"AMD might've slightly missed Q3 revenue targets, but the company confirmed a long-term bullish trend. Investors should focus on the Q4 revenue growth of 48% and annual run rate of $8.4 billion. The stock only trades at 20x a 2020 EPS target of $1.75. A realistic 2021 EPS target of $2.50 would help the stock achieve a $50 price target next year using a 20x P/E multiple."
4302640,2019-11-05,AMD Set To Dominate Intel Server Technology Through 2020,Leaked Intel roadmap suggests that Ice Lake server chip is unlikely to be competitive with AMD Rome. AMD Rome will be an easy winner in 2020 against both Intel Cooper Lake and Ice Lake server products. AMD prospects continue to make AMD one of the best semiconductor stocks to own for 2020.
4303899,2019-11-07,AMD On Track,"AMD has refreshed its portfolio with a richer product mix of CPUs and GPUs which set to challenge Intel and Nvidia heads on. The high-end server products allow AMD to increase its profit margin to 44-45% without giving up the low pricing advantage on the low-end products. For the first time of a long time, AMD finally has a decent chance to grab a meaningful share of GPU and CPU markets and deliver profitability simultaneously. AMD has to recognize the risk that Intel’s lineup of 14nm parts, 10nm, and an expansive portfolio of product adjacency will only regain some of the market share back. Considering both the growth and risk ahead, AMD shares look to hit mid to high $30s and stick by 2020 and low $40s in 1H 2021."
4304456,2019-11-08,AMD: Taking Patent Dynamics Into Account,"An analysis of AMD’s patent activity and patent dynamics. AMD’s patent scorecard, weekly and historical patent value, risk and disruptive scores in relation with stock price, market capitalization and competitors provide useful information to the investor. A look at AMD's in terms of technical analysis. Implications for AMD's stock price."
4306678,2019-11-14,AMD: Intel's Ice Lake Servers Fail To Deliver,"New information on Intel's 10nm Ice Lake servers indicate a lackluster value proposition.
         AMD's EPYC Rome is poised to continue as the dominant product offering in the market.
         This is further evidence of Intel's manufacturing failures."
4307560,2019-11-18,AMD Is A Better Recession Choice Than Peers,
4309107,2019-11-26,AMD: Big Investors Are Bulking Up,
4309567,2019-11-27,"Melt-Up Alert: Amazon Rises, Intel Hurts Dell, HP But Helps AMD, And Deere Likely Phase One Winner","GDP is above 2%. Where is the recession? With that fear behind us, stocks could rise even higher than expected. Amazon is finally on the move, go with that flow. I think Alibaba moves with it as well. Intel mistakes hurt revenue for Dell and HP Inc. This only helps Advanced Micro. Even though the Phase One deal looks like it will happen and the December 15th deadline for rising tariffs will be delayed, I am executing my hedging plans."
4309670,2019-11-28,AMD: The $15 Billion Plan,"Investors need to start considering a plan for AMD reaching $15 billion in annual sales. The company only needs to achieve a rather meager 25% market share in desktop, notebooks and server. The initial EPS target is $3 based on $15 billion in sales."
4310159,2019-12-02,AMD: Pressure On In 2020,Shares have more than doubled so far this year. Yearly estimate gap continues to widen. Short interest takes a fall.
4310058,2019-12-02,Nvidia Vs. AMD: Not A Zero-Sum GPU Game,"Like Intel in the CPU space, Nvidia has started feeling AMD’s threat in the GPU space. Unlike Intel, Nvidia has been able to keep its dominance a little longer. The current analysts’ estimate suggests that Nvidia may lose at most 2-3% GPU market share to AMD in the next two years. Market share gain is more important to AMD than to Nvidia as AMD has a much smaller market share to start with. AMD shares are trading at a premium relative to Nvidia shares, reflecting AMD’s forthcoming GPU market share gain. Even with a projected 2.5% market share loss to AMD, both Nvidia and AMD shares will still gain as long as the entire AIB pie gains. There is no zero-sum game in the GPU market."
4310433,2019-12-04,Intel Vs. Advanced Micro Devices: Not A Zero-Sum CPU Game,"Since 2017, Intel has lost 10% PC CPU market share and 5% server market share to AMD. The current analysts’ estimate suggests that Intel may lose another 2% CPU market share to AMD in the next 2-3 years. Market share gain is more important to AMD than to Intel as AMD has a much smaller market share than Intel to start with. AMD’s shares are currently trading at a premium relative to Intel shares, reflecting AMD’s forthcoming CPU market share gain. Despite a projected 2% market share loss to AMD, Intel shares will still gain from the annual 5% growth of the CPU space."
4310967,2019-12-05,AMD Can Justify Its 'Forced To Be Perfect' Valuation,"Fundamental data suggest that AMD is now achieving a valuation that has more or less priced in perfect performance. Smaller obstacles or bad news can make the share price of a company run out of fresh steam quickly. However, I believe that some bear investors are overlooking the fact that AMD has the ability to make strategic price changes at any time. This would also change the valuation."
4310926,2019-12-06,AMD: Rally On,
4311751,2019-12-10,AMD: Black Swans Do Not Last Forever,"The 3990X chip is monumental. AMD has had a fantastic run, but it might be over. Reducing the position might be the wisest choice."
4312144,2019-12-12,AMD Short Interest Drops Again,More than 14.4 million shares covered in second half of November. Is this just an unwinding of the convertible bond trade? Short interest approaching a 3-year low.
4312435,2019-12-13,AMD: Not Priced For Perfection,"AMD isn't priced for perfection based on the Nvidia path. Investors tend to forget that AMD was priced for a financial disaster back in 2016. Nvidia has more normalized growth projections and still trades at 30x forward EPS estimates. My $15 billion revenue, $3 EPS plan would position the stock for substantial gains in the next few years inline with Nvidia from a few years ago."
4313125,2019-12-19,AMD Is Selling Like Hotcakes,
4313591,2019-12-23,Tech Is Just Getting Started Going Into 2020,
4314612,2019-12-30,Why AMD Shares May Slip At The Start Of 2020,
4314739,2019-12-31,A Realistic Valuation Of AMD Shares,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have gained 80% and 150% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. But AMD’s actual financials have not nearly arrived on the same order. The market has priced in a momentum factor which is from the expectation of AMD’s ability to gain meaningful CPU market shares in the near future. For a momentum stock, AMD investors tend to overweight future distant revenue, or future market share gains. At $46, AMD share is mildly overvalued by $3 after the momentum being considered. If the price premium is a result of positive sentiment,  AMD sentiment value tends to reverse itself in 2-3 weeks."
4315513,2020-01-06,My Top Tech Pick Of 2020 - AMD Has Beaten The S&P By 15x Since I First Recommended It,"AMD has performed incredibly well since I originally recommended it as My Top Tech Pick of 2018, returning 15x the S&P 500 average. The company has incredibly strong long-term potential, it has continued to gain server market share and dominates in the desktop CPU markets. The GPU markets are pending a big release in March 2020, and the company's financials have continued to improve significantly. I recommend AMD as my top tech pick of 2020. Let me know what you think in the comments below."
4315504,2020-01-06,AMD: Possible Three-Peat In 2020,"AMD topped the S&P 500 with a nearly 150% gain in 2019 after leading the index in 2018. Investors shouldn't bet on a three-peat performance, but the stock has the possibility for another strong year. My 2020 EPS estimate remains $10 billion revenues, $1.50 EPS plus a longer term $3+ EPS target."
4316089,2020-01-09,AMD Shines As Intel Struggles At CES,"AMD presented a strong product lineup at CES. We discuss some of the intricacies. Intel, on the other hand, hardly had much to say about products and stayed with a big-picture presentation. AMD continues to be in market share gaining mode against Intel and Nvidia."
4315950,2020-01-09,AMD: Critical Q4 Earnings Ahead,"AMD will be reporting its Q4 earnings report later this month. Investors should closely monitor its ASP and shipment growth, the chipmaker's margin profile and its management's revenue guidance. Investors should stay vigilant and shouldn't blindly trust that AMD's shares will continue to rally post earnings as well."
4316167,2020-01-10,AMD's Bulls Are Growing Even More Bullish,AMD's Options traders are betting the stock rises to around $62 by April. The technical chart indicates the stock may be entering a blow-off top phase. The stock is priced for perfection with no room for error.
4316535,2020-01-13,AMD: The Expectations Gap,Q4 investor expectations rise as shares surge toward $50. 2020 revenue estimates continue to hit new highs. Short interest dips below a major level.
4318430,2020-01-22,AMD: Fundamentals Trending Higher,"AMD shares are still on a tear, reaching $48.60 at the time of writing. The business is currently valued at $57 billion. I find this rally hard to believe. The way I see it, AMD shares are prone to a negative catalyst, meaning a negative catalyst could cause a huge downward adjustment in the stock. However, fundamentals trend higher. AMD's real opportunity is in the x86 CPU market. AMD is able to attack multiple growth vectors without much competition from Intel: notebook (Ryzen Mobile), desktop (Ryzen), and server (EPYC). As of writing, Nvidia is valued at $145 billion on exclusively GPU. Intel is valued at $260 billion on CPU and memory. AMD is valued at $57 billion while attacking both the CPU and GPU markets. Reiterating HOLD, PT raised from $28 to $44."
4318442,2020-01-23,AMD: The 50% Revenue Growth Quarter Is Finally Upon Us,I'm bullish going into earnings. The company had a huge guide for this quarter. Valuation isn't great anymore but momentum is strong enough.
4318916,2020-01-24,AMD: Shorts Flee Ahead Of Q4 Earnings,"AMD is scheduled to report its Q4 results next week but short interest declined by as much as 5% ahead of earnings. Its short interest as a percentage of overall floating shares has declined to 5-year lows. This lends credence to the bull thesis, which suggests that AMD's shares still have plenty of upside in store."
4319352,2020-01-27,AMD: Gloom And Doom Vs. To Infinity And Beyond,"Entering earnings season it's advisable to own some fire insurance via options to avoid wild card disasters. AMD has had a great run and it could continue, but they have to crush earnings. I think some caution is warranted in the short term. We list our options plays for this rather saucy time period in order to maximize potential gains while keeping things rational."
4319161,2020-01-27,"Continue To Expect Earnings Upside For Intel, Good Sign For AMD On Tuesday","Intel reported a blowout quarter. It's a good sign for AMD, which reports on Tuesday. Underlying demand trends look strong. Intel's guidance sounds conservative."
4319991,2020-01-29,"AMD Earnings Okay, Not Great","Company beats on top and bottom lines for Q4. 2020 guidance was mixed, follows in steps of 2019. Short interest has continued its recent decline."
4319954,2020-01-29,AMD: Good Enough,AMD slightly beat analyst estimates for Q4. The market is disappointed with Q1 guidance and the projected growth rates for exiting 2020. The stock trades below 25x a realistic 2020/2021 EPS target of $2.
4320254,2020-01-30,AMD: A Bubble In Search Of A Pin,Advanced Micro Devices tanked on weaker 2020 guidance. The key driver was not the revenue but the lack of profitability at close to the apex of the cycle. Investors buying on hope of more upside must be prepared for a 90% downside case.
4320719,2020-01-31,AMD Stock Might Have Climbed Too Fast Despite Solid Performance In 2019,"AMD had a great run in 2019, as the company improved its financials and maintained stable profitability. The company has a great future with significant catalysts awaiting in 2020. However, the stock might have risen too fast for the market to digest. The valuation leaves little room for error."
4320713,2020-01-31,Advanced Micro Devices: Continuing To Revamp The Company,"Advanced Micro Devices is focused on continuing to revamp the company. The company has an impressive asset portfolio. The company is quickly becoming dominant in the CPU business, with market share growing rapidly and margins improving. I expect the company's profits will increase, pushing its P/E ratio down from 90 in 2019 to 15-16 by 2021-2022, assuming no share price increase. This cash could reward shareholders. I recommend investing in AMD for the long term."
4320787,2020-02-02,AMD: Do Not Confuse A Bubble With A Foundation,"AMD has now released its fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 figures. And while the numbers were even slightly better than I expected, the share price has gone down quite a bit. I believe that the release of the numbers was not the needle that caused a bubble to burst, but merely a correction, as the company's fundamentals remain extremely strong. The prospects are therefore initially geared towards further growth."
4321070,2020-02-03,AMD's Perfect Situation Is Not Sustainable,"AMD is in a perfect situation, which is not sustainable. Intel is constrained by supply problems, has issues with their latest node, and has degraded performance because of security mitigations. NVIDIA is a node behind AMD, yet has the highest performing GPU."
4320952,2020-02-03,"Xilinx Has Cratered, But That Doesn't Mean It's On Sale","Xilinx's valuation has been decimated following their recent earnings report. The gloomy consensus surrounding the stock at present creates a seemingly attractive entry point, but further investigation reveals we need a steeper discount. Notwithstanding, Xilinx continues to capitalize on the growth of 5G, artificial intelligence, and a host of other secular tech trends requiring their programmable chips."
4321444,2020-02-04,Why Xilinx May Not Yet Have Hit Bottom,"Q3 FY2020 was expected to be a weak quarter, but Xilinx still managed to disappoint with a number of revelations. The company announced a reduction in its workforce, lowered its outlook and revealed that 5G is not going as hoped for. Xilinx has changed its stance on several issues, including Huawei and revenues returning to previous levels. Yet with all this bad news, there is reason to think that more bad news could be in store for Xilinx."
4324111,2020-02-13,AMD: The Trend Continues,"Short interest drops yet again, likely due to trade unwinding. Analyst estimates jump to top end of guidance range. Shares continue their amazing run."
4323822,2020-02-13,AMD: The Perfect Setup,
4324409,2020-02-14,AMD Continues To Chip Away At Intel,"AMD made significant market share gains against Intel in all segments in 2019. Comparison of AMD and Intel's products suggests that AMD offers more and at a lower price, meaning AMD will continue to gain on Intel. Although Intel is 10 times bigger than AMD, AMD is growing at a much faster rate. Bottom Line: Intel is great, but AMD seems to be a better investment."
4324969,2020-02-18,AMD's Massive Rally May Be About To End,
4325256,2020-02-19,The Coronavirus Impact On AMD Is Underestimated,"The wide-spreading coronavirus has led to the conclusion that a financial impact that's worse than SARS' is imminent. The U.S. semiconductor sector is likely hit the most for its over-reliance on China in both production and revenue generation. Supply chain analysis shows that AMD has close to 25% Greater China revenue and more than 30% Greater China supply chain exposures. Based on SARS experience, both AMD’s Q1 revenue and EPS will be likely lowered by at least 10%. Current market underestimates the negative financial impact from the coronavirus."

4326945,2020-02-25,AMD Continues To Gain Market Share: A Good Sign For Growth In 2020 And Beyond,"Advanced Micro Devices continues to capitalize on the competitive advantages currently benefiting the Desktop and Semi-Custom segments. A feasible case can be formed around the belief that a material portion of today’s competitive advantages will not be transient, but instead will be accretive to long-term growth. AMD's balance sheet improved materially in 2019, fueled by improving cash flow from operations and significant deleveraging (a net reduction of $429M to long-term debt). Five-year price target of $113 (+97% over the recent closing price of $56.89 on 2/19/20). I currently hold AMD in both the Gunderson Premier Growth and Ultra Growth Portfolios."
4326757,2020-02-25,Alpha Trader Talks 'New Paradigm' Tech With Mark Hibben (Podcast),"This week's Alpha Trader features hosts Aaron Task and Stephen Alpher talking tech with Mark Hibben of Rethink Technology. Also up for discussion are the continuing coronavirus developments. A sizable economic slowdown now seems assured, and that's brought the potential for another round of rate cuts back into play. While the market averages may have brushed off much of the cornoavirus concern, Task notes about half the stocks in the Nasdaq are in bear markets - that is off 20% or more from 52-week highs. So take away the MAGA names and high-flyers like Tesla and Virgin Galactic, and it's already pretty ugly out there. Hibben isn't scared away by the gaudy one-year returns for a lot of the tech names he holds. He reminds that the big gains follow the major losses seen in the last few months of 2018. Still, Hibben acknowledges valuations are getting a little perky at these levels, and he's not finding a lot to buy right now. What Hibben calls new paradigm semiconductor companies (mostly Apple, but names like Samsung and Huawei also fit) are those that design most of the processors put into their products. At first derided as a Steve Jobs folly, Hibben argues that the shift has been perhaps the major reason for the massive profits at Apple over the last decade."
4328749,2020-03-02,AMD: Last Chance Below $50,"AMD dips below $50 on global coronavirus fears. The chip company should update financial projections at the Financial Analyst Day this week with the potential new goal of obtaining 25% market share in the server space. Based on 2020 TAMs, AMD could reach revenues of ~$19 billion based on 25% market share. At $45, the stock trades at ~15x forward EPS estimates topping $3."
4329464,2020-03-04,AMD: The Big Guys Keep Buying More,"Institutional investors bought about 1% of AMD's shares outstanding in the last 13F reporting cycle. Apparently, a good number of these institutions bought AMD's shares and reduced their holdings in Intel. This trading trend corroborates the existence of the bull thesis for AMD and should come across as an encouraging sign for its investors. The recent correction in AMD's stock price offers an attractive entry point."

4331134,2020-03-11,AMD Highlights Path To The Future,"After a gangbuster performance on the stock market for the last several years, Advanced Micro Devices, its CEO Dr. Lisa Su, and its executive leadership team have been under the glare of a lot of media attention recently. Despite the apparent pressure, however, the company keeps coming out swinging and the announcements from last week's Financial Analyst Day indicate that AMD is showing no signs of letting up. All told, it was a very impressive set of announcements that highlights how AMD continues to build on the momentum it started to create a few years back."
4332102,2020-03-16,"AMD: Upgrading From Hold To Buy, PT Raised From $44 To $52","AMD shares have fallen ~34% off their highs on COVID-19 fears and a general market pullback. At AMD's 2020 Analyst Day, the company reiterated their Q1 and FY'20 guidance. I would've expected a large bounce in the stock, and in after hours trading, the stock was up as much as 7%. Since then, the rally has faded greatly. AMD confirms that COVID-19 is having an impact on the supply chain, but the company reaffirms Q1 and FY'20 guidance. Supply chains are """"normalizing."""" They are not seeing long-term ramifications. AMD updates their TAM estimates, long-term financial model, and future product roadmaps. Expect incremental growth in gaming and PCs, but the story will be driven by datacenter growth. Upgrading AMD from Hold to Buy, PT raised from $44 to $52."

4333393,2020-03-21,"AMD Drops A (Smaller) Bomb On The 5G Network, But Won't Reach 10% Share In Q2","I recently described Intel's 5G victory lap by introducing a full silicon portfolio for the 5G network. At its financial analyst day, AMD announced it will enter this space and become a competitor to Intel. This increases AMD's TAM by over $20 billion. While this is a big announcement for Epyc, telcos may be less inclined to transition to AMD than the enterprise. AMD may lack purpose-built networking hardware and has nothing to compete with the low-power, low-cost Atom architecture often used in networking. Interestingly, this announcement also means AMD won’t reach its (misleading) claim of 10% market share by Q2. Instead, AMD has guided to 6.7% market share."
4333671,2020-03-23,AMD: Welcome To The Pivot Point,AMD has fallen 32% off the highs in February. AMD is going to have explosive revenue and earnings growth over the next two years. AMD has leaned on the 200-day moving average in the past and is trying to do so again.
4333831,2020-03-24,AMD: The Bittersweet Moment,"AMD's share of shipments at Mindfactory increased during the first week of March. Overall shipments for both the chipmakers marginally declined compared to February levels, which lines up with my previous assessment that AMD isn't as severely hit as bears would suggest. Investors shouldn't indulge in panic selling."
4334133,2020-03-25,AMD: Work From Home Boost,The Work From Home economy is set to boost data center demand. AMD is poised to take market share from Intel in the growing data center space. The stock has long term EPS potential above $3 making the stock a bargain down at $40.

4334987,2020-03-30,AMD Is Making A Comeback,"AMD has invested heavily in its tech and we expect this to pay off in the next decade. The semiconductor industry is still high growth and we expect it to continue to give value to investors. Out of all the players, AMD appears to offer the best value."
4335495,2020-04-01,AMD: Advanced Bullish Sentiment,"AMD has comparatively performed well in times of high volatility. The performance already indicates a bullish sentiment among investors. Paradoxically, the relatively stable performance is counteracted by the high valuation. Given the high valuation, I would have expected a somewhat stronger correction. However, there are several factors that investors should be aware of and which support the bullish sentiment. Overall, there is an excellent risk/reward ratio for double-digit price gains because it is likely that AMD will reach its February highs as soon as the clouds disappear."
4337811,2020-04-15,Advanced Micro Devices: A Solid Buy,Continues to gain market share in both consumer and enterprise computing segments with long-term growth driven primarily by datacenter growth.

4338561,2020-04-20,AMD: Still Going Strong,AMD's CPU and GPU market share continues to grow. 7nm manufacturing process could further boost AMD in its competition against Intel. Possible catalysts: Release of PS5 and Xbox Series X and work from home shift.
4338494,2020-04-20,Updating My 'Short' Thoughts On AMD,"Having revisited the facts, I feel much more confident in my strategy that utilizes far-out-of-the-money options.
         In the first article, I had underestimated some of the monopolistic power that AMD has in the x86 7nm space.
         The rise of the stock offers the opportunity to extend the expiration in better terms than before.

4339630,2020-04-24,AMD Earnings Must Deliver,"AMD is scheduled to report its Q1 earnings on April 28. Investors should closely monitor its shipment growth figure, its management's guidance for Q2 and for the year, their comments around PC demand trends, and the timeliness of their product roadmap. It seems likely that AMD would exceed its Q1 revenue guidance in its upcoming earnings report."
4340427,2020-04-28,"Xilinx Still Has Growth Drivers, But The Street Has Gotten More Cautious","Xilinx's fiscal fourth quarter beat a lowered bar, with some more notable outperformance on the margin lines. Markets like auto, commercial aero, and general industrial are likely to be substantially weaker in Q2, and the wireless business has shrunk by more than half on increased ASIC substitution. The company has weathered big swings between bullishness and bearishness before, but management needs to rebuild confidence in long-term drivers like 5G wireless and data center. Shares aren't really """"cheap"""" yet, but they're trading at a much more reasonable valuation than they historically have, and they're worth watching as a sentiment reversal opportunity."
4341531,2020-04-30,AMD Fails To Deliver,"Q1 results mostly in-line with expectations.
         Q2 and full year guidance weaker than expected.

4342325,2020-05-02,Advanced Micro Devices: Immense Challenges Ahead,"AMD hasn't been this healthy in many years. However, many large challenges are now emerging. These challenges will grow ever more intense over the next 1.5 years and beyond."
4342777,2020-05-04,Advanced Micro Devices: Trend Flip,AMD reported strong Q1 results that the market viewed as mixed. The chip company remains on track for substantial sequential revenue growth in 2H of 2020. AMD should take meaningful market share from Intel this year. The stock remains cheap based on out year EPS projections of over $3.50 per share.
4342566,2020-05-04,AMD: Curb Your Enthusiasm,"AMD posts robust growth numbers for 1Q20, though underlying there were signs of weakness in the data center business. The full-year guide moves lower on COVID-19, but I think expectations may still be lofty, particularly with regard to server and PCs. At ~50x forward earnings, a wide premium to its peers, this is a stock that embeds considerably lofty expectations, in my view."

The company is developing ACAP, a highly complex computational platform to target the growing data center, AI and 5G markets. The company is presented with great opportunities ahead, however near-term challenges and strong competition make us believe that the company is trading at a fair price."
4347146,2020-05-13,Quo Vadis AMD: Too Good To Be A Bad Investment,"Currently, AMD has again reached a point where it was before the COVID-19 volatility. There is also the question of how to proceed with the share price gains. It is clear that there is no unlimited growth. The P/E ratio is also quite high. However, I think that marketing timing at AMD is the wrong way to go. Investors need to put the high P/E ratio into perspective. The excellent balance sheet and operating performance also underline that (further) share price increases are justified."
4349081,2020-05-21,AMD: Big Bets Are Being Placed,"Institutional ownership in AMD increased during the last 13F cycle. The chipmaker has a slew of launches lined up for 2020 that can bolster its financial and operational growth, so it's really no wonder why institutions bought more of AMD. Investors should ignore the FUD and remain long on the name."
4349726,2020-05-23,"AMD: First Entering Intel's Turf, Now Nvidia's","AMD's newly announced GPU, the Radeon Pro VII, is equivalent to Nvidia's high-end GPUs, but at a fraction of the cost.

The company is improving both margins and its overall financial health, which will lead to increased shareholder returns and fiscal strength."
4350060,2020-05-26,Xilinx Needs More Time To Recover,"Xilinx's top and bottom line shrank in Q4, and the forecast calls for more of the same in Q1 FY2021. Trade restrictions continue to cause problems for Xilinx, and even more restrictions may be looming. End markets that had not been as affected by trade restrictions could face a bigger threat with the coronavirus. The combination of increased trade restrictions and a lingering coronavirus will likely extend the time needed for Xilinx to get back on track."
4350298,2020-05-27,AMD: 100X P/E Ratio Is Not Supported By 2020 Revenue Projections,No stock can maintain a 100x PE ratio without booming revenue. A recession/depression will depress overall demand. Competitor Intel is projecting a weak quarter 2. Competitive ARM processors are being used by Amazon and Microsoft.
4351007,2020-05-29,AMD: Heading To $70,"AMD has the best-in-class products to reach 25% market share without capping the upside. Even analysts have EPS targets topping $1.50 in 2021, making the stock cheaply priced at $50. The base case is for 2021 EPS targets approaching $2 and a $70 stock."

The stock remains cheap with reasonable 2021 EPS estimates hitting $2.
4353585,2020-06-14,"AMD: Back Half Drivers, Stock Fair Value",AMD’s partnership with Nvidia shows the strength of its EPYC CPUs. Increased capacity at TSMC might indicate management expects strong demand. Next-generation gaming consoles will drive AMD’s growth in the second half of the year and next year. AMD is in a good position to capture a large part of the demand for data centers. Trade risks could weigh down the stock.
4355285,2020-06-24,AMD: Rally On,AMD's market share at Mindfactory stood at 91% in the first half of June. Shipments declined sequentially for both AMD and Intel as brick-and-mortar started to come online. Investors should remain long on the name.
4355910,2020-06-26,AMD: Staying Invested Despite The Economy,"AMD is well-positioned in the face of economic headwinds. Expect consumer segment weakness in the latter half of the year. This will be partially offset by datacenter growth and next-gen console releases. The company is in market-capture mode; with best in class CPU offerings, there's a very large market opportunity to realistically grab away from Intel in most computing segments. At an NTM EV/S estimate of 6.9x, the risk-reward is attractive for an entry point."

         While AMD is experiencing a number of fundamental tailwinds for their business, one remains vastly under-covered by retail investors, sell-side investors, and even fund managers it seems.
         AMD could have a huge 2020 and 2021 in the console market, a markets that has been sluggish for quite a while now.
         Considering the fact that AMD is the sole provider of SoCs in both of the next-gen consoles discussed here, they are bound to benefit no matter who comes out on top. No other chipmaker on the market has this upside opportunity.

Milan is due for the end of 2020. Epyc has played a large part to fuel investor momentum, despite being a small part in volume, as it has increased AMD's growth expectations. AMD had a great chance to capitalize on Intel’s 10nm server delays, but word on the street is that COVID-19 has slowed Epyc adoption significantly. This means Epyc adoption could fall below AMD and investor expectations, and serve as a downside catalyst. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon: In a rainstorm, the guy with the biggest umbrella usually stays the driest."
4361068,2020-07-27,AMD: Another Intel Gift,Intel just delayed key manufacturing technology another 12 months. AMD should finally grab substantial market share gains in key server chips. My EPS target for AMD is now set at ~$4 based on the chip company reaching 25% market share off a $79 billion TAM.
4361578,2020-07-28,AMD: Monster 2020 Guidance,"AMD reported a monster a quarter with a massive hike in 2020 guidance. The chip company now forecasts 2020 revenues growing 32%, up $440 million from previous analyst estimates. My future $4 EPS target based on 25% market share gains appears far more certain after upping 2020 guidance."
4361298,2020-07-28,Intel's 7nm Delays Are AMD's Gains,"Intel announced that it's been hit by a yet another process ramp delay, this time around for the 7nm node. The development should benefit AMD in numerous ways. Readers and investors with a long-term time horizon may want to buy and hold AMD."
4362103,2020-07-29,AMD: Not Worth It At $75,"I have been advocating a Buy rating on AMD for some time, and I see still see the fundamentals as extremely strong. My problem now is the valuation, which is stretched. While Intel continues to dangerously stumble especially on iterating on new nodes, AMD has begun to take advantage. AMD is seeing strong growth at all ends of the x86 market. Intel's stumbling and AMD's innovation combined have led to AMD becoming the performance leader in the x86 space. This means it will be able to address high-performance, high-margin segments. While the company continues to scale market share in PCs (desktop and notebook), the main catalysts for the stock will be consoles and server market share expansion. This seems priced in by now, however. Downgrading from Buy to Hold, PT set at $68."

The recently-announced Intel miscues strengthens our belief that a material portion of AMD's existing competitive advantages will remain accretive to long-term growth. AMD's market capitalization surpassed $89B on Wednesday, closing at an all-time high of $76.09. Shares were changing hands at $1.93 back in July of 2015. AMD remains my largest holding. We continue to be """"very bullish"""" on the shares."
4365080,2020-08-06,AMD: Crossing A Well-Deserved $100 Billion Valuation,AMD has an impressive portfolio of CPU and GPU assets and its recent quarter was a blowout. The company is well on the path to gaining market share from Intel and has performed incredibly well in the most recent quarter. The company has the ability to grow its EPS going forward which should result in significant shareholder rewards.
4367324,2020-08-10,AMD Is Not Half An Intel,"When Intel announced the 7nm news, AMD stock gained as much as Intel lost. Investors view Intel’s loss as AMD’s gain. The market is mistaking. Intel is a data-centric conglomerate. AMD does not compete in most of Intel’s growth opportunities. The extent of the purported (future) Intel losses is also highly questionable. AMD is not worth half as much as Intel and seems to have run up mostly on opportunism and dreams. The second half will provide investors with much additional information (potential catalysts) about both businesses."
4367834,2020-08-11,Intel Tiger Lake Will Likely Crush AMD,"In a previous article, I suggested that Intel was likely to crush earnings. Intel delivered. Of course, since market share evolves slowly, this might not be fully representative of the current product competitive environment. In the past quarter, many have voiced that AMD currently has CPU leadership, a sentiment further ‘proved’ by Apple’s switch away from Intel silicon. However, Intel’s upcoming Tiger Lake will likely crush AMD in single-thread performance while being competitive in multi-thread, despite having half the number of cores. AMD’s purported ‘leadership’ is merely one of appearance: its products simply contain ‘more’ cores, not ‘better’ cores. AMD does not have a moat."
4368333,2020-08-13,It's Time To Sell AMD,"AMD is worth nearly $100 Billion, without the fundamentals to support it. AMD's rapid ascent is based on an environment that is becoming less favorable. AMD is priced to grow explosively, which is nearly impossible to sustain."

While the product is huge leap in performance compared to the previous generation, past disclosures from AMD suggest that it may be in the hunt for the high end with Big Navi. If AMD can pull off a high-end alternative, AMD investors could see a GPU battle with Nvidia, which is somewhat of a repeat of its recent CPU battle with Intel."
4372724,2020-09-04,AMD's Big Navi GPU Might Still Be Relevant Against Nvidia's 3xxx,"Nvidia recently launched its Ampere GPUs, the first 2 generational skip since 2004. The GPU blows what many had expected from Big Navi out of the water at an impressive price point. So far, we only have leaks for AMD, and the Nvidia leaks were wrong, but it remains to be seen what happens. Whether Big Navi is still relevant will come ultimately down to the decided price point."

It's the biggest chip deal ever and should certainly change how you see NVDA's valuation. The deal is a significant threat to AMD, which relies on the ARM architecture. With its ownership of the ARM architecture, Nvidia is shaping up to look more vertically integrated in its business structure and probably deserves some overweighting in chip investors' portfolios."
4375799,2020-09-22,AMD To Move More Of Its Business To TSMC,"Taiwan Economic Daily is indicating that AMD is increasingly moving its wafer fabrication business to TSMC. Why would AMD want to move more production to TSMC which is already production constrained? This article explains the rationale. AMD will start relying more and more on TSMC in the future for chips including CPUs, GPUs, and IO devices."
4375780,2020-09-23,AMD: New Highs Imminent,AMD's market share increased further in the first half of September. These gains should encourage OEMs and consumer-facing datacenter applications to adopt more Ryzen SKUs going forward. AMD's market share in other channels and markets is likely to increase as well.

Xilinx would offer attractive leverage to significant growth in markets like data center and 5G wireless, but the FPGA business is very different than what AMD knows. A bid in the $120's would be a fair price for Xilinx shareholders, though the exact structure of the deal (price, cash vs. equity) remains to be seen."
4378735,2020-10-12,"AMD And Xilinx: The Prize Is Versal ACAP, Not FPGAs","The acquisition of Xilinx will add FPGAs to MPU and GPU sectors that AMD competes with Intel.

4378727,2020-10-12,AMD And Xilinx Deal: A Xilinx Investor Perspective,"AMD's rumored acquisition of Xilinx is being made possible by a strong gain in AMD market capitalization over the last few years. The acquisition would make sense for Xilinx stockholders as the Company and stock have underperformed lately and could use a stimulus. While some investors see the takeout premium as small, the deal value is likely to be in the $30-$35B range and not much higher."
4378636,2020-10-12,AMD: Turning Point For Shorts,Short interest drops to multi-year low. Rumored acquisition would be quite large. Arbitrage opportunity could attract short sellers.
4378568,2020-10-12,AMD: Unlikely Xilinx Deal,"AMD is in pursuit of Xilinx in a deal with a rumored value of $30 billion. The rich valuation of Xilinx approaching 10x sales makes the deal difficult to become accretive. AMD currently has faster growth than Xilinx, making the premium valuation difficult to swallow. The numbers aren't supportive for a deal, but investors should prepare to listen to AMD CEO Lisa Su before dumping the stock on an announced deal."

It looked interesting to me and I established a small position. Later I reached out to Philip Freidin, a true expert in semiconductors, AMD and especially Xilinx. He's been so generous to let me interview him about the technological merits of the deal. It was a great pleasure and I've learned an incredible amount about semis but also cemented a newfound appreciation for Xilinx and its unique business model in semiconductors."
4379036,2020-10-14,Why Xilinx And Its FPGAs Have A Bright Future With AMD (Or Not): Part 2,Video interview with industry expert Philip Freidin. Philip worked at both AMD and Xilinx and made design choices based on estimates of future market fit. He's extremely knowledgeable about the products of companies and helped me understand the dynamics of a potential deal better. But much more importantly I gained new insights in the semiconductor industry and the beauty of the FPGA. This is the second installment of a three-part-interview.
4379361,2020-10-16,AMD Zen 3: Still Benefiting Mostly From Intel Delays,"AMD has announced its latest Zen 3 CPUs. It delivers a larger-than-expected generational performance increase. However, despite a +19% IPC improvement, it barely overtakes Intel’s latest CPUs in single-threaded performance. AMD is benefiting immensely from Intel’s multi-year product delays, which continue to be visible. While AMD has taken the performance crown, it will likely lose this in 2021 to Intel."
4379555,2020-10-17,AMD To Acquire Xilinx: The Imitation Games Continue,"AMD rumored to acquire Xilinx for $30B, following on the heels of Nvidia acquiring Arm. In my Nvidia-Arm analysis, I remarked Nvidia is imitating Intel to at least some degree, with the reverse also being true. A Xilinx acquisition by AMD would imitate Intel’s 2015 Altera acquisition. Potential synergies include AI, DPU and 5G. Data center is also a small, but growing segment. AMD's data center group is currently led by the former VP of Intel's Programmable Solutions Group. I called Nvidia-Intel the 'semi battle of the decade'. It seems AMD does not want to be left behind."
4379808,2020-10-19,AMD: A Gambler's Bet,"Following an eternity of operational struggle, AMD finally turned the corner on the economic value creation front under its excellent leadership team. Even as management successfully laid the foundation for future growth, investors must look elsewhere for capital distributions in the absence of buybacks and dividends. Those who buy AMD today might wake up one day realizing the colossal disconnect between fundamentals and valuation in a painful way."
4379801,2020-10-19,AMD Vs. Nvidia: The Winner And Still Champion Is Nvidia,Nvidia's financial metrics are superior even before the ARM deal. Nvidia's margins are vastly better than AMD's. AMD's lower margins mean less FCF (Free Cash Flow). Should AMD be worried that Nvidia's ARMy is coming? Company managers are relatively the same.
4380055,2020-10-20,Fresh Ideas To Profit From The Xilinx/AMD Merger Rumors,"Rumors have been widespread since 10/8/20 of a deal pending for AMD to acquire Xilinx in a $30 billion deal. The rumors are countered by several analysts that argue it is not a good fit. Overall, a simple market buy is a crap-shoot at this time. I present a strategy to produce asymmetric high yield coupled with double-digit downside market protection, all bundled in a short-term 60-day exposure to market risks."

4381666,2020-10-27,Quick Review Of The AMD/Xilinx Deal,The annualized expected return on the AMD/Xilinx deal looks like it will be around 8%. I don't love that return although the deal looks like it could be on the safer side for a semi deal. I wouldn't mind having a position especially as it's one that's easy to hedge. Overall I'm inclined to believe there's going to be a better opportunity down the road.
4382260,2020-10-28,AMD's Acquisition Of Xilinx Doesn't Seem Like Such A Great Deal,
4383862,2020-11-01,Advanced Micro Devices: A Few Thoughts After Xilinx,"AMD is acquiring Xilinx after what has been a much rumored deal. Xilinx's shareholders received fair value for their shares in terms of sales, as its higher margins are offset by slower growth. AMD is obtaining crucial capabilities and will become a more diversified growth play following the deal, although at a steep price. Despite great actual and product leadership, I have some reservations here, solely relating to the valuation."
4384630,2020-11-03,AMD-Xilinx Acquisition: AMD Investor Perspective,"AMD and Xilinx are not a great strategic fit in traditional terms but there seems to be enough here for the AMD-Xilinx deal to work.

I expect 20-30% Y/Y Q4 2020 revenue growth driven by GPU sales. AMD's newest RX 6000 GPUs were revealed to match NVIDIA's RTX 3000 cards in performance and will launch when current market demand far outstrips supply. Going into 2021, AMD's expanded access to TSMC's 7nm node will allow greater manufacturing capacity for high-end consumer GPUs, giving the opportunity to compete with NVIDIA on performance and price."
4387247,2020-11-09,AMD's Most Important Month In Review,"At the start of October, we said that the month would be AMD's most important month ever. The company's new CPU launch was on track, and its GPU launch, with special features that require an AMD CPU, seems better than expected. AMD's all-stock Xilinx acquisition cements its recent multi-year share price gain. We expect AMD earnings and margins to continue to grow."

4394894,2020-12-15,AMD's Stock Will Struggle Under The Weight Of Xilinx,AMD's deal for Xilinx is dilutive to existing shareholders. AMD will need to issue a lot of stock to complete the all-stock transaction. Most of the benefits of the deal is washed away by new shares.
4395426,2020-12-18,AMD: Next Leg Up,"AMD trades near all-time highs after breaking above resistance around $95. The stock traded in a similar pattern earlier this year prior to a fast $30 gain. The chip company recently provided strong financial projections for 2025. The stock isn't cheap near $100 based on internal projections, but AMD appears poised to head higher."

4396572,2020-12-29,AMD: Expect Strong 2020 Performance To Continue,"AMD was our top technology investment for 2020 and more than doubled the returns of the NASDAQ. AMD had an impressive release of products in 2020 that will continue in upcoming years, which is fundamentally what matters. The company's Xilinx acquisition, an all-stock acquisition, was intelligent and well-timed. I expect the company to be able to drive valuable, long-term, growing EPS."

According to Esoterica Capital CEO Bruce Liu, the move to 5G is not so much an upgrade to an existing tech cycle as a re-envisioning of the entire tech stack. Investors should take note when Liu discusses anything 5G-related: his firm's flagship ETF, WUGI, has doubled up on peers FIVG and NXTG since launching in late March, returning nearly 100%. Liu explains why the move to 5G is perhaps the greatest investing opportunity of the next decade - and how WUGI is perfectly positioned to benefit."

4400539,2021-01-23,Xilinx: Merger With AMD Is A Positive,"Xilinx is being acquired by Advanced Micro Devices as part of an all-stock transaction. However, the market seems not to be looking at the deal with a positive eye with some analysts affirming that AMD has over paid. Still, it is important to look at things from the changing dynamics perspective in the semiconductor industry. Xilinx's financial results have been improving over the quarters and improved metrics are expected for Q3-2021 during earnings announcement on January 26. It makes sense to purchase shares of the FPGA company based on current valuations."
4400886,2021-01-25,AMD: Focus On Positive Trends,"AMD should top Q4 financial projects, but the key is 2021 and beyond guidance. The chip company is facing supply constraints that has allowed Intel to maintain higher than expected sales. The company is facing strong long-term trends that aren't altered by Intel announcing a new CEO. The stock remains on pace to generate a $3+ EPS in the next few years."
4401187,2021-01-26,AMD Q4: Another Strong Report,Company beats on top and bottom lines. Q1 and full year 2021 guidance much better than expected. Shares likely to hit a new high in the triple digits.

AMD will inevitably grab far more market share from Intel. I explain why you need to include this stock in your portfolio. I point out what you need to watch out for going forward."
4402612,2021-02-02,AMD's Earnings Justify Its Valuation,"AMD has had an incredibly significant several years, however, 2021 will truly tell whether the company's hard technical work translates into massive earnings growth. We expect the company to end 2021 with a P/E of ~40 based on its earnings and to continue growing at double digits. Longer term, the company's success remains on it continuing its recent competitiveness with Intel and Nvidia."

4406336,2021-02-16,AMD: Full Throttle Expansion Across All Market Segments,"AMD is ramping up its strongest product portfolio ever across all market segments in client and data center CPU and GPU and semi-custom chips for next-gen gaming consoles. It continues to capitalize on Intel’s issues by solidifying its process node leadership with Ryzen 3 and Milan processors and is gaining market share accounting for 20% of client CPUs. The recent launch of next generation gaming consoles by Sony and Microsoft is another key growth driver as a key supplier with shipments forecasted to grow by 50% in 2021. The company could close the Xilinx acquisition deal by the end of 2021, combining AMD’s CPU and GPU strength with Xilinx’s FPGA and ACAP products strengthening its data center capabilities."

4412254,2021-03-08,AMD: Overvalued And Caught In The Storm,"The company is currently overvalued based on its revenues, in our view. Supply storm will evolve from blessing to curse for semiconductor manufacturers. General economic climate sets the stage for some brutal price corrections. We believe the company should be valued at $69.79 per share, although increased market exaggeration may push price lower."
4412213,2021-03-08,AMD Server Story Becomes Incrementally Better With Zen 3 EPYC,Intel server roadmap is lagging AMD server roadmap with Ice Lake likely falling far short of Zen 3 EPYC. Sapphire Rapids might be a closer competitor to Zen 3 but seem to lag AMD equivalent by almost a year and is more likely to compete with AMD Zen 4. AMD should gain considerable server market share in 2021 as a result.
4412793,2021-03-10,Rotation Away From Growth Stocks Providing An Opportunity On AMD,AMD has gotten caught up in an apparent sector rotation and has dropped almost 20% in the past month. The company's fundamental indicators show that it has been growing earnings and revenue at great rates over the last few years with the growth accelerating recently. The stock is hitting support currently and it is close to being oversold. Sentiment toward the stock isn't nearly as bullish as it should be.

4414093,2021-03-15,AMD: If You Sell Now Then You Might Leave Money On The Table,"AMD is not as vulnerable to the chip shortage as previously believed. As AMD is expected to deliver over 50% revenue growth in 2021, but its chip capacity can only increase by 20%. Potentially, 30% of the orders may not be filled. When chip capacity expansion catches up with the sales growth, AMD will get out of the tight supply by September 2021. AMD has been traded at a 15% discount compared to the Street's target prices since the last earnings call. Investors may have overreacted to the short-term supply shortage. Since unfilled orders are only delayed but not gone, selling AMD at such a discount is equivalent to leaving money on the table."
4414182,2021-03-16,AMD Refocuses On Business With Latest Epyc And Ryzen Pro Launches,"AMD has been building up its business-focused offerings, as evident from the back-to-back launches of its latest third-generation Epyc server CPUs and its Ryzen Pro 5000 series mobile processors for enterprise notebooks. While each of the new chips is optimized for their very different needs and applications, they do share a number of enhancements that are at the heart of Zen 3 cores, including larger, unified caches for faster processing with larger data sets. This new architecture makes it easier for multi-threaded applications capable of simultaneously using all those cores to fully leverage the full cache, resulting in significantly improved performance for these types of programs. In addition to performance enhancements, AMD added several hardware-based security improvements, which are becoming increasingly important for businesses of all sizes."

4417828,2021-04-06,AMD's Shares May Have Priced In Milan's Future Success,"AMD’s Milan server CPU can achieve an impressive performance improvement by design shifts alone, without the move to a lower manufacturing node. Milan looks to increase AMD’s server market share by 1%-2% a year and propel 2021 revenue growth over 40%. Without Milan, AMD shares may be overvalued at the current $81, per linear pricing on forecasted fundamentals. With Milan’s exponential growth potential, AMD may be valued around $83, before the $10 accretion from Xilinx’s merger. AMD’s current price may have priced in Milan’s success."
4418674,2021-04-12,AMD: Still A Buy,"The Xilinx acquisition is to AMD what the Altera acquisition was supposed to be. There is a steady, emerging shift toward AMD in the datacenter segment. The supply constraints in the semiconductor industry are beginning to loosen, which will directly benefit AMD. Overall, I recommend buying AMD, selling puts, and/or engaging in a pair trade with Intel, AMD being the long leg."
4419805,2021-04-19,AMD: Still Great Prospects,"AMD's share price has corrected in recent months after last year's rally and is now 15 percent below its all-time high. This correction was overdue. Looking ahead, I see further upside potential for shareholders, although the picture is no longer quite as promising as in recent years. The share price still needs some time to reach an appropriate valuation, which could be the case in two years. If the company manages to maintain its strong market positions and address the growing future markets with innovations and competitive products, long-term investors will find an investment that is currently not excessively overpriced."

4421780,2021-04-27,AMD: Intel Risk Dispelled,AMD smashes Q1 financial targets. The company provides guidance for 50% revenue growth in 2021 leading to a $2.10 EPS target. The stock should easily top $100 with 2022 EPS estimates eventually topping $3 with the accretive Xilinx deal.
4422590,2021-04-29,AMD: It's On You If You Don't Buy The Dip,"AMD had a miracle 1st quarter, and the firm built on previous gross margin gains. Revenue growth accelerated in the 1st quarter, and AMD raised its FY 2021 revenue guidance. Continual sales growth driven by a strong product line-up indicates more upside."
4423627,2021-05-02,AMD Has Become Undervalued,"AMD had a solid Q1. In fact, accelerated growth in the wake of the stock sell-off/plateau might have caused a short-term undervaluation. Long-term, increased competition from Intel clouds visibility. Article also demonstrates that cloud digestion is real. Management’s refusal to address its cloudy earnings segments unnecessarily obfuscates performance. Given AMD's higher growth rate, it is quickly approaching Nvidia's revenue levels despite almost 4x lower market cap."
4424203,2021-05-04,AMD: Here's Your Opportunity,Shares slide despite very strong earnings report. Xilinx deal will help to offset growth slowdown concerns. Technical pressure should reside in the near term.
4424694,2021-05-05,AMD: Epyc Milan Is Even More Epic Than You'd Think,"AMD was overpriced, but fundamentals are quickly catching up to its valuation and provide investors with an entry opportunity. AMD Epyc Milan annihilates Intel's current offering and becomes the go-to-guy for data centers. Network Function Virtualization is an aspect the market is not fully pricing into AMD's Epyc offering."
4424579,2021-05-05,Can AMD Stock Price Reach Nvidia's Levels,"Despite blockbuster quarterly results, AMD’s share price has fallen double digits year to date.

4430607,2021-05-21,AMD: Not The $4 Billion Reasons To Own,"AMD announced a $4 billion share buyback cheered by the market, yet only amounting to 3% of the combined company once adding Xilinx. The combined company expects billions in additional revenue by 2023 in comparison to when the merger was announced just in October. The stock is cheap as 2022 EPS estimates start pushing toward $3."
4430464,2021-05-21,AMD: Cell Phone Domination (The Hidden Catalyst),"Samsung commands 23% of the global cell phone market and the AMD deal from 2019 is about to bear fruit. Consumers have overlooked this little talked about deal. Once they wake up to the fact that 23% of the cell phone market is tapped by AMD, the hype will start. Ignoring the CPU market, it is this cell phone hype which might offer an unexpected bonus to investors acquiring AMD at the current depressed prices."
4430941,2021-05-24,AMD: Still Too Expensive,"AMD continued to deliver astonishing top line growth numbers over the past year, reaching more than 90% in the last quarter. Contrary to the outstanding operational performance, share price underperformed the market on a risk-adjusted basis. High-growth expectations already built into the price are largely to blame, while the cyclical nature of the industry should also be considered."
4431944,2021-05-28,AMD And Snowflake: Best In Class,"I performed old-fashion bracket tests to select the best one of the four stocks to buy now. The goal is to make the largest return by 2021. Mainly near-term sales and margin forecasts are used to differentiate the near-term share performances of four high-water mark tech stocks. INTC and AMD are in the same bracket for obvious reasons. By 2021, AMD most likely outperforms INTC. SNOW and PLTR had a very similar triple-digit lifetime performance just months after their IPO. Yet, SNOW may beat PLTR. In the end, AMD most likely beats SNOW. AMD may be the best near-term performer among the four tech stocks."

The current consolidation pattern could remain in place for a while, until business growth catches up to AMD's above-average valuation. Thanks to a solid long-term growth outlook, shares of AMD have significant upside potential through 2025, but investors shouldn't expect returns like the ones seen since 2016."
4434592,2021-06-13,AMD Continues To Win,"AMD's technological dominance and business momentum show no sign of slowing down. Yet, skepticism around the stock has been increasing. However, as long as Intel lags over the next two years, AMD should continue to do well."

Although some may assume AMD could grow into its valuation, in the logical scenario, Intel would gain a lot more market cap. Even using conservative estimates (and generous ones for AMD), Intel would still be 3x larger than AMD in 2030.

In the long term, AMD’s success is dependent on TSMC. Conversely, process leadership is a requirement for Intel to be able to overtake AMD.

Prepare For Restored Momentum Soon,"AMD has lost more than 20% of its value this year, underperforming the broader market as investors continue to assess the impacts of a murky economic outlook on its valuations. But even after taking into consideration the valuation contractions observed across AMD's peer group due to recent market sentiment, the stock remains undervalued. AMD's fundamentals continue to demonstrate potential for extending its consistent track record of outperformance, thanks to its continued commitment to innovation which has complemented its growth in market share. The company is also well-situated within a strong demand environment, as it forges towards becoming a key enabler of critical technology trends underpinning global digital transformation in coming years. The stock will likely see some rebound momentum in the latter half when supply chain constraints and the current market storm are expected to ease, and fundamental outperformance re-emerges as investors' focus."

The closure of the Xilinx acquisition lowers the risk around the fresh batch of shares being added. The company has an impressive portfolio of assets it's continuing to launch but it's continuing to suffer from the silicon shortage. The company has the double strength of increasing margins and increasing revenue which will support increased shareholder returns."

4507815,2022-05-06,AMD: Consolidating Its Way To The Top,"AMD reported robust results this week that suggest it is nowhere near a slowing cycle. In fact, its continued consolidation of complementary industry peers like Xilinx and Pensando will unlock additional TAM and drive greater synergies ahead. The company continues to benefit from acceleration across all business segments, underscoring the essential role it plays in enabling critical technologies of our generation. Favourable trends remain, as the company is expected to finish the first half of the year with strong double digit growth despite economic uncertainties ahead. The second half will see continued improvement buoyed by new product launches and the return of seasonality demand. This suggests the stock will not trade at a discount to its peer group for long, as investors' confidence return on robust prospects of strengthening fundamentals in coming quarters."
4509414,2022-05-10,AMD: Growth Priced As Value,"AMD’s true economic or owners’ earnings have been consistently better than its accounting earnings.

Instead, AMD just revealed IPC would increase by less than 5% and total performance by only 15%. This means Zen 4 is not the CPU people thought it would be. AMD’s competitiveness will decrease going forward."
4513961,2022-05-24,AMD: 30% ASP Growth Supports Higher Stock Price Target,"We looked into the PC market which declined by 7.3% in Q1 2022 and projected its unit shipments to decline by 2.1% and 2.2% for desktops and notebooks in FY2022. By analyzing 141 products and higher average pricing growth in desktop (30.6%) and server CPU (69.1%) markets, we determined that AMD commands premium CPU pricing. Lastly, we examined the gaming console market and we determined its sales had lagged the previous generation by -5.1% due to supply constraints. Overall, we project AMD's revenue growth at 37.3%, which is driven by its continuous ASP increase, justifying our price target increase on AMD shares."
4514710,2022-05-26,AMD Stock Price Prediction: Can It Rise Back To $150?,"AMD has sold off with the larger tech grouping in Q1 and Q2 this year. That said, its decline seems to have been arrested early in the drop vs. most tech names. We set out the company's fundamentals and technicals below, and review the stock's upside and downside potential. We believe the stock can be accumulated as long as stop-losses are respected."
4514968,2022-05-27,AMD: Read Off Nvidia's Earnings,"AMD-competitor NVIDIA cut guidance for the current quarter below analyst estimates due to a revenue shortfall from Russia and China. AMD only reported 3 weeks ago and didn't see similar impacts on gaming sales in China. The stock isn't priced for the chip company to even match conservative analyst estimates, reducing the risk of a major hit to the stock price. AMD continues to trade at only 17.4x our '23 EPS targets despite the superior sector results."

We observed that AMD stock has moved into a decisive bearish bias for the first time in over five years. We observed that the market formed two bull traps in March and June, as it rejected further buying momentum. However, a potential bear trap could form at the current bottom. Our reverse cash flow valuation model indicates that the market could be preparing for a steeper sell-off to moderate its valuation, given slower topline growth. Therefore, we revise our rating from Strong Buy to Buy. However, given its bearish bias and the market's rejection of buying momentum, we urge investors to layer in with caution at the current levels."

AMD will need to adjust estimates down. AMD's 3Q22 outlook clearly reflects the continued weakening of the PC and gaming GPU market demand. Both Nvidia and Micron announced a sharp pullback in their businesses. We expect AMD's client business to be further impacted as we believe the PC TAM will normalize further in 2023. Data center is not magically immune to growth slowdown. AMD is relatively expensive, trading at 21x C2023 P/E EPS $4.88 compared to the peer group average of 16x. Like Nvidia and Micron, AMD will need to revise estimates down. We believe AMD's stock price has yet to reflect these incremental downsides."
4532153,2022-08-10,"AMD: 20x P/E, 54% Gross Margin, Strong Growth","As opposed to previous quarters, AMD did not beat its own guidance for Q2’22 revenues. The chip maker also issued a light forecast for Q3’22. Despite growing headwinds in the PC market, AMD remains a top bet on Data Center growth."
4534527,2022-08-15,AMD: Market Immunity,AMD still seems set to generate significant growth through next year. The chip company has the ability to steal $10+ billion in additional Data Center sales. The Embedded segment from Xilinx has massive growth and remains supply contained. The stock remains cheap at 16x forward EPS target of $6+.
4534531,2022-08-16,AMD: Outstanding Execution And Reasonable Valuation,"AMD is delivering remarkably solid performance in a tough environment. Importantly, AMD is widely outperforming Intel and gaining market share at record speed versus its main competitor. AMD is very reasonably priced based on current expectations, and the company has an impeccable track record of widely outperforming those market expectations. Economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions can weigh on the sector in the short term. In the long term, however, AMD is well positioned for market beating returns."
4535642,2022-08-18,AMD: Hard To Go Wrong With Rock-Solid Execution,"AMD's rock-solid data center and embedded segments help the company overcome intense headwinds in the consumer segment that has buffeted Intel and NVIDIA. We are confident that AMD should continue gaining market share against Intel through FY23 as it launches its new EPYC chips with higher ASPs. AMD's market share representation could see further gains, which should help undergird its valuations. We believe AMD's golden era against Intel in the next few years is intact. Coupled with the company's """"flawless"""" execution, we believe the market has re-rated AMD, requiring lower free cash flow yields. We reiterate our Buy rating on AMD."
4535689,2022-08-19,AMD: The $1.3B Reason To Remain Bullish,"AMD is indeed firing on all cylinders, given the aggressive boost in market share in the desktop, notebook/mobile, server, and overall x86 segments by FQ2'22. We expect to see super-charged growth ahead, given the immense expansion in its R&D expenses for the past two quarters. However, with NVDA's earnings call and the Fed's next interest hike on the horizon, we may see a potential stock weakness for AMD in the near term. That may prove to be a more attractive entry point for long-term investing, if one had missed the recent bottom in July 2022."

It issued its preliminary results on August 8 and cautioned a 19% revenue decline from the prior quarter. And on August 9, President Biden signed the 2022 CHIPS Act into law. Investors should pay special attention to comments from the management during the earnings calls on the potential impact. I think comments on this front can cause sizable upward price movements. Also, I will compare it with AMD, another fabless chip business, to better anticipate and contextualize the impact."

Nvidia has an immediate threat to $400M in revenue, while AMD has none. However, seeing the 25%+ Chinese revenue share for both companies proves AMD's accelerator products are subpar in performance. But the victory comes with stable revenue in this market environment, and AMD wins on that front."
4539677,2022-09-08,Is AMD Stock A Good Investment In Current Semiconductor Industry Conditions?,"AMD's Q2 2022 results and FY 2022 guidance were decent, but the weak conditions in the semiconductor industry have been a drag on its recent share price performance. Worldwide semiconductor sales decreased by -11.3% MoM in July 2022, but AMD can make up for the general industry weakness by taking share away from the competition. AMD's stock is a good investment notwithstanding current semiconductor industry conditions, as it can outperform the broader semiconductor market with share gains."
4540535,2022-09-13,AMD: Building Resilience Amidst Economic Uncertainty,"Despite the semiconductor headwinds, AMD's acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando can lead to best-in-class growth, offsetting the projected weakness in gaming over the next year. AMD remains on track on its new product roadmap, and the upcoming 4nm-based Zen 5 launch in 2024 targets more performance gains with further optimization for AI workloads. AMD is improving its competitiveness across CPU and GPU products with Ryzen, EPYC, and Radeon Vega platforms, expanding its market share. Despite the worsening macroeconomic environment and the escalating US-China tensions, AMD is a strong buy at current levels."

4541277,2022-09-15,AMD: Zen4 And Xilinx Unlock Next Growth Cycle Amid Bloodbath,"AMD is now trading at 17.6x FW P/E, the lowest level in several years. Its Price/Earnings/growth ratio, or PEG, is 0.57x, only about half of Peter Lynch’s favorite threshold of 1x for high-growth stocks. As such, AMD stock now offers a highly asymmetric return profile. A 20%+ annual return is likely, yet the downside is limited even if AMD's valuation further contracts. Furthermore, AMD's imminent Zen4 chips and Xilinx synergy provide additional strong catalysts to propel the next growth cycle."
4541963,2022-09-20,"Yes, AMD Is Now On Sale",AMD's shares have been beaten down after US regulators barred it from exporting MI250 GPUs to Chinese datacenters. But the selloff has been overdone.

4541977,2022-09-20,AMD: The Dislocation Between The Stock And The Industry,"Not all semi stocks are the same. The industry-wide selloff has produced dislocations in value - such as AMD. AMD is a market share gain story. The macrocycle influences all fundamentals, but the selloff seems to be pricing in excessive pessimism. AMD remains under-represented in the data center despite its recent gains in the opportunity. The growth here should continue against a $50B+ TAM. At an NTM P/E of 17.2x, AMD is undervalued. Market is likely pricing in more earnings contraction, but risk/reward is present for long-term investors. Long-term, the world will continue needing more data, and more computing. Investors should take comfort in this fact when looking beyond a recession."
4543202,2022-09-26,AMD: A $200+ Stock When The Market Wakes Up,"AMD's stock has been undeservedly hammered (down 60% from highs) due to weakness in other semiconductor firms. However, AMD has reported earnings growth (67% growth YoY), guided higher, and recently implicitly reaffirmed their guidance. Even if economic conditions are challenging, AMD earnings are set to explode higher. AMD is trading at 15x current earnings and 7x predicted 2023 earnings. It's a coiled spring ready to rocket when the market wakes up."
4543479,2022-09-27,AMD: Don't Get Stuck On 2022 Fears,AMD has dipped below $70 to lows not seen since early 2020. The chip company remains on pace to take market share and grow in the face of macro issues. The stock trades at only ~11x 2023/24 EPS targets.
4543441,2022-09-27,AMD Set To Lose Nvidia As A Customer,"We usually see AMD and NVIDIA as just competitors. NVIDIA is also an AMD customer, but it will stop being so. This move has a meaning, in a broader context, which is relevant both for AMD and Intel."

4543713,2022-09-28,AMD: Can It Go Lower?,"The semiconductor sector has been the hardest hit out of all amid the extended selloff this year. Despite its high-double-digit growth expected in the current year, with continued fundamental outperformance demonstrated in 1H22, AMD has lost close to 60% of its value since peaking in November '21. The stock now trades near its all-time historical low valuation multiple of under 4x EV/sales, drawing questions to whether it could trend lower. The following analysis will walk through AMD's key growth drivers, as well as its looming investment risks, and perform a sensitivity analysis on its current market value to gauge whether the implied perpetual growth aligns with the company's fundamental outlook."
4543683,2022-09-28,NVDA Vs. AMD: Which Is The Better Buy?,"Can Nvidia and AMD sustain their impressive growth, especially in light of the new US ban on AI-Enabled Chip Sales to China on national security concerns? Just 5 years ago, Nvidia’s stock traded at around $40 a share, AMD, around $10 a share. Flash forward to today and Nvidia’s shares 5X’d and AMD’s 10x’d. M&A should become increasingly more challenging for AMD and Nvidia, so I would expect their returns on invested capital to moderate/diminish over the long term. The Chinese lockdown and pandemic-related supply chain problems have slowed chip fabrication. But on the other hand, the conflict in Ukraine threatens the global energy market and could spill into a global recession."

In February 2022, AMD acquired Xilinx, which better positions the firm to capitalize on a ~$135 billion market opportunity across cloud, edge, and intelligent devices. Through our enterprise cash flow analysis process, we assign AMD a fair value estimate of $120 per share.

The acquisition of Pensando will further expand the company’s data center portfolio with a high-end processing unit and software."
4545113,2022-10-06,AMD: Now A Strong Buy,"AMD was one of the brightest examples of tech stocks gone wild when the market peaked in November 2021. Now that AMD's stock is down by 60%, it may be one of the brightest examples of a strong buy. AMD's forward P/E valuation was at about 60, around the highs, but is only 15 now. AMD has substantial growth potential and significant profitability prospects. AMD's stock should appreciate considerably as the company advances in future years."
4545019,2022-10-06,AMD: Be Greedy When Others Are Fearful,AMD’s shares are currently trading at a heavily discounted price. Weakening fundamentals in the gaming business are fully priced into AMD’s valuation. New product launches could lead to a revenue bump for AMD in Q4’22. AMD's valuation relative to Nvidia is highly attractive.
4545344,2022-10-07,AMD: Another Man Down,"AMD pre-announced a big miss on Q3 revenue due to a weak PC market, which again should not come as a surprise. The read-through is negative for most chipmakers, from Intel to Nvidia. On the bright side, AMD's Data Center business posted strong growth and will likely continue to take share from Intel even if demand slows. I expect more bad news and choppy price actions in the near term."

Preliminary results and 2Q22 results suggest that data center will remain relatively resilient and meet market expectations. In my view, AMD will continue to see a multi-year growth story in data centers as it is well positioned for growth in the industry. I think that AMD is one of the stocks to own when recession has been priced in and my 1-year target price is $90.50, implying 40% upside from current levels."
4545822,2022-10-11,AMD: Shocking Inventory Correction Will Pass,AMD surprised the market with weak preliminary Q3 numbers.

Nvidia,"Semiconductor stocks are now trading at levels last seen in late 2020, as the sector reels from a rapid demand slowdown that has been further complicated by frayed U.S.-China relations. The newly imposed ban of advanced chip technology exports to China by the U.S. government risks severing a significant source of sales, given the region represents the largest semiconductor end-market. With AMD and Nvidia being industry leaders in advanced semiconductors used in everything from data centers and cars to laptops, the new rules are poised to reduce their TAMs."
4547296,2022-10-18,AMD: The Decline May Not Be Over,"AMD stock has plunged in 2022. Revenue and earnings estimates have been slashed, and the risk of further downgrades is not over. The stock is at risk of falling below $50 based on the technical trends."

AMD still is projected to have nearly 29% year-over-year growth overall even with the miss in PC Revenue. The company is growing significantly in their datacenter, gaming, and embedded revenue business. CEO Dr. Lisa Su has performed one of the best company turnarounds in our history, and I believe there is more to come. AMD's operational excellence and growth opportunities are continuing to widen against most of the competition."
4547084,2022-10-18,AMD: 4 Reasons To Be Long-Term Investors Now,"Long-term investors should not be afraid of deeply cyclical stocks like AMD. Its deep cyclicality provides some of the best buying opportunities (and also selling opportunities too when we get to the other end of the tunnel). Surely, AMD will face extreme volatility in the near term due to a combination of its cyclical nature and the recent export regulations. However, if you have a timeframe longer than 5 years, you have favorable odds for oversized rewards. Its margin expansion potential, well-executed operation, and strong financial strength could lead to triple-digits total return in 5 years."

This article dissects the return drivers in the past, based on which an outlook for Q4, and more importantly, the next 5 years is provided. Q4 is likely to be impacted by weakness in the PC sector too. Sales for its PC products fell by 40% YoY in Q3. Although I see these near-term risks have been fully priced in already. As such, the 5-year outlook is very bright, with ~14% annual return from a combination of P/E expansion and organic growth."

4554497,2022-11-07,AMD: Days Of High Growth May Be Over,"AMD pre-announced a significant revenue miss in Q3 (despite still raising guidance in Q2), driven by its massive client collapse. Arguably the results are significantly worse than both Intel and Nvidia, especially given that AMD had been unable to predict the collapse well over a month into Q3. In addition, AMD’s latest Zen 4 CPUs are unable to stand out from Intel’s own new Raptor Lake, despite having a node advantage with 5nm. AMD’s RDNA3 chiplet-GPU looks a lot like an Intel Ponte Vecchio clone. AMD is relegating itself to Amateur Micro Devices. Investors should be cautious, as its days of high growth may be finished."

For AMD's Client business, its priority in 3Q22 and 4Q22 is to clear the inventory situation, which will result in AMD being in a solid position heading into 2023. Management remains focused on investing in strategic growth areas like Data Center, Embedded, and commercial segments while remaining conservative on consumer-oriented segments.

4566777,2022-12-28,AMD: Brace For Impact,"AMD investors have learned that with a premium valuation comes elevated expectations. But no company is immune to macro headwinds and industry challenges. As such, AMD's collapse in 2022 is justified, as the market needs to de-risk its valuation to account for execution risks. The question is whether the selloff is done. AMD could continue to gain share against Intel. But who doesn't expect that? The critical question is whether AMD's share gains are fast enough to propel its recovery in 2023. AMD's October lows could be re-tested by the bears. Hence, investors adding here need to be cautious and not put all their faith in Dr. Lisa Su."
4566735,2022-12-28,AMD Vs. Intel Stock: Which Is The Better Buy? Both Are Good Over Different Time Periods,AMD's share price is down more than 58% and Intel's is down more than 49% over the year. Intel has a substantial 5.6% dividend. Both companies have a bright future over the next few years.

4566975,2022-12-29,"It Is What Is, AMD Is Not A Buy",I did dozens of buy AMD recommendations from 2014 to 2021. I am now changing my opinion. AMD is losing market share on x86 processors and GPUs. The PC and discrete GPU markets are both declining. AMD has suffered a YTD performance of -58.35%. Wall Street analysts remain bullish. The big YTD decline of AMD’s stock has not eliminated its relative overvaluation. I rate AMD as a sell because of its GAAP forward P/E ratio of 48.47x. Technical indicators are saying the negative price momentum has more fuel.
4567165,2022-12-30,"AMD: Focus On Progress, Not The Trough","Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. remains focused on a data center market poised for massive growth due to AI, machine learning, and the metaverse, leading to a $125 billion total addressable market by 2027.

4573679,2023-01-30,AMD: Don't Sweat The Intel Quarter,"Intel Corporation reported a bad quarter, casting doubt about demand in the chip sector, but the chip giant has its own problems. AMD has already been hit with a PC inventory correction, and the lack of a pre-announcement for Q4 similar to Q3 is very positive. AMD stock is cheap at normalized EPS in the $5 to $6 range when the economic weakness and inventory correction ends."
4573588,2023-01-30,AMD: Reinvigorate Your Core - Gaining On Intel In Data Centers,"After the poor results from Intel's Q4 report it becomes even more evident that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is taking away market share in Data Centers and AI. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, AMD is better positioned to offer technology to capture a growing share of DC and Embedded markets. After a very bad year in 2022, AMD is off to a great start in 2023 and the stock is a Buy ahead of earnings."
4573567,2023-01-30,AMD: Nearing Inflection Point,"As Beijing reopens China and aims to improve its relationships with the West, there’s an indication that the semiconductor industry and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s stock in particular could greatly rebound. AMD’s decent performance in a turbulent macroeconomic environment gives reasons for optimism. While the geopolitical risks will continue to haunt AMD for years to come, I have become increasingly bullish about the company’s stock in 2023."
4573530,2023-01-30,AMD: Brace For Pain,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is scheduled to report its Q4 results after market close tomorrow 1/31. The chipmaker is likely to be revenue-challenged. Pay close attention to AMD's inventories, purchase commitments, and segment financials."

4574207,2023-02-01,AMD: Simply The Best,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. beat estimates on both lines for Q4 2022. The performance in the data center market was great. Q1 may not be as good as Q4, but AMD still is the leader in its peer group."
4574197,2023-02-01,"We Rate AMD At Accumulate Following Q4 Earnings, Long-Term Price Target $210",AMD reported a solid Q4 yesterday after the close. The company's strategic position continues to improve just as Intel's weakens. We rated AMD at Accumulate heading into earnings and keep the same rating now. We believe this stock to be an excellent long-term hold candidate.
4574132,2023-02-01,AMD: Q4 Report Rather Mixed,AMD beats on top and bottom lines for final period of 2022. Current quarter guidance was a bit mixed. Inventory levels something to watch through 2023.
4574405,2023-02-02,AMD: Growth Story Finished,"Excluding the inorganic Xilinx component, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is headed for around a 27% organic revenue decline going into Q1. The growth story is finally finished. As estimates are inevitably reduced, the rich valuation will only become richer. While AMD may be more diversified than competitor Intel, the ease with which investors are ignoring the PC bloodbath is too convenient. With a rich valuation and the end of the multi-year growth story, it is time for AMD investors to bail."

4579167,2023-02-16,"AMD: Still Bullish, But Don't Expect Outsized Gains Anytime Soon",We touch upon a few developments that have stymied the potential for solid upside in the short term. The risk-reward on the relative strength chart and forward valuations for AMD's stock still looks very attractive. AMD is still a BUY.
4579542,2023-02-17,AMD: Underperforming The Market While Margins Hit All-Time Highs,"As Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s revenue and margins hit an all-time high, investors continue to underperform the market once we account for risk. Forward revenue growth is no longer the only game in town for semiconductors, and that's bad news for AMD. In addition to the product roadmap, investors should pay close attention to decisions regarding capital allocation."
4580005,2023-02-20,AMD: Growth Story Far From Over,
4579834,2023-02-20,AMD: This Is A Clear Winner,"AMD’s growth story is far from over. The company is likely to grab additional market share in the data center industry in 2023 and beyond. As Chinese-related risks subside, AMD’s stock has every chance to appreciate further in the following months."
4581077,2023-02-23,AMD: Strong GPU Growth Despite Nvidia Competition,"We analyzed and determined Nvidia’s superior PC GPU performance advantage against both AMD and Intel but AMD’s superior performance growth based on benchmark scores from PassMark. We expect AMD to continue losing share as its GPU performance per pricing had declined by an average of 17% across its past 3 generations. Despite this, AMD’s data center GPU revenue is forecasted to grow strongly in line with our forecast of the cloud infrastructure market of 39.2% in 2023."
4582169,2023-02-26,AMD: AI Chip Boom,NVIDIA ushered in an AI chip boom with an inflection point in the current quarter. AMD announced several new AI chips in the last few months with plans to accelerate development and new product releases during 2023.

4582378,2023-02-27,AMD: Cashing In On The AI Buzz,
4582667,2023-02-28,AMD: Don't Miss Out On The Opportunity,"AMD's management has a substantial track record of delivering growth with successful product launches like Ryzen, Epyc, and Radeon. AMD demonstrated 4Q2022 results above consensus despite softening PC demand. Management is confident that the company is well-positioned to capture increased penetration and adoption of technology, especially Artificial Intelligence. My valuation calculations together with multiples analysis suggest stock has a massive upside potential significantly outweighing risks."
4583768,2023-03-02,AMD Stock: A Strong Buy With Promising Growth Potential,
4584870,2023-03-06,AMD: Are You Following The Story?,"Up more than 30%-plus from our last article two months ago, AMD is now telling us what the next chapter is likely to be. We update our composite view of where fundamentals meet technicals. There are those that will spin a compelling narrative for AMD. Do the current fundamentals concur? Lyn Alden provides her most recent take. We share a specific setup in AMD that may soon point to a reversal of the latest rally."
4585079,2023-03-07,Swing Trade AMD,"We last recommended investing in AMD in November and since then it has heavily outperformed the S&P 500. The company is a solid swing trade, especially in an environment with both short and long term risk. We recommend selling AMD at this time and then waiting for a more opportune investment in a downward market."
4586082,2023-03-09,Nvidia Vs. AMD: A Clear Choice,"The AI Wars should significantly boost and support the growth outlook for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., and even more heavily NVIDIA Corporation, for the foreseeable future. Both stocks have partly recovered from the recent plunge in 2022, with Nvidia having an impressive recovery of around 65% YTD. The market is undervaluing AMD's bright prospects in the data center, and the stock price remains below my short-term target price of $100. The AI hype has aided in closing NVDA's undervaluation gap, offering limited upside potential from current levels."
4585893,2023-03-09,Nvidia Vs. AMD: Which Stock Is A Better Buy?,
4588238,2023-03-17,AMD: Tone Deaf To Demand Headwinds - Downgraded To Sell,
4587350,2023-03-18,AMD: Winning The Generative AI Battle Likely Won't Be Easy,"AMD may have won two of the supercomputer contracts thus far. However, it still lags behind NVDA in terms of PC and discrete GPU market share. While it remains to be seen how AMD's MI300 may perform, market reviews for NVDA's H100 have been stellar for training large language models. With the battle for generative AI at a fever pitch, it appears that market sentiments surrounding AMD's execution remain uncertain, worsened by its lower-than-expected forward guidance."
4590157,2023-03-26,AMD: Next $100,"AMD has finally rallied back to $100, but the market should really be focusing on the next $100. The chip company is still set to take substantial additional server market share from Intel before even focusing on AI demand. The stock trades at a steep discount to the forward P/S multiple of NVIDIA allowing for an easy double. AMD should generate substantial EPS growth to warrant another $100 gain over the next few years."
4590690,2023-03-28,"AMD: You Snooze, You Lose","AMD has rallied approximately 50% this year, as industry optimism for a 2H recovery grows alongside the AI boom and recent speculation for easing monetary policy by year-end. But macro conditions continue to point to a fragile set-up for AMD and the broader semiconductor industry, with near-term risks still skewed to the downside. As such, cautious optimism is warranted in the near-term as the stock faces a bumpy road to recovery ahead."
4591024,2023-03-29,AMD: No Longer The Bargain Bin,"Despite facing persistent downstream headwinds, AMD has impressively bounced back almost 90% from its October 2022 lows. The recent AI frenzy has likely lifted its performance. AMD has also outperformed its peers in the SOXX ETF since early January. Be wary of its recent upward momentum - while late buyers may be tempted to jump in, AMD's valuation is no longer a bargain. Could AMD's momentum hit a wall as buyers lose steam? Investors should exercise caution and resist the urge to chase. Instead, waiting for a potential steep pullback sparked by negative news could be a smarter play."
4591201,2023-03-30,AMD: The Bull Is Ready To Strike,"AMD's shares are up by 75% from their October lows but the rally might still continue. The chipmaker's market share gain story remains alive and its upcoming key launches stand to catapult its growth further. Also, the stock is trading at a steep discount compared to industry levels, making it a compelling buy at current levels."

4596128,2023-04-24,AMD: A Buy Ahead Of Earnings Report,"Semiconductor players are starting to see industry recovery toward the end of 2023, which will likely mean that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. will also report similar views in the coming earnings report. As the market recovers, AMD is expected to have an outsized gain as the company takes further market share while benefiting from the industry recovery. AMD has a fair valuation, warranting a buy thesis."
4596042,2023-04-25,AMD Stock Earnings Preview: What To Watch For (Rating Downgrade),
4596798,2023-04-26,AMD Q1 Preview: 4 Things I'll Focus On,Advanced Micro Devices is scheduled to report earnings on May 2 post-market for its 2023 FY Q1. I expect to see signs of the end of margin contraction and also asset utilization contraction. I expect to see a strong balance sheet and the continuation of share repurchases. These signs will provide insights not only into AMD’s own business but also the overall status of the cycle in the chip sector. I will listen closely to management's comments and data that either confirm or contradict my above expectations.
4599124,2023-05-02,AMD Dips On Weak Q2 Guidance,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Q1 results beat estimates on top and bottom lines. AMD Q2 revenue guidance, however, calls for a sequential decline. AMD inventory continues to rise a bit."
4599120,2023-05-02,AMD: A Second Half Growth Story,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. reported mixed Q1 2023 results, beating analyst estimates, but revenues and EPS dipped from prior year levels. The chip company is poised for a second-half rebound, with the Client business rebounding and market share gains in data center and AI. AMD stock remains cheap, trading below ~20x consensus '24 EPS targets and far below normalized EPS targets."
4599117,2023-05-02,AMD Q1: Beats Expectations But Weak Guidance,
4598811,2023-05-02,AMD Q1 2023 Preview: Xilinx And EPYC In Focus,"Despite its tepid guidance for sequential declines across all core business units, with the exception of its embedded segment, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s Q1 2023 results are expected to be headlined by data center results. This is consistent with better-than-expected hyperscaler demand (a critical end-market for AMD) observed in tech earnings last week, despite tempered expectations amid a still-weak IT spending environment. We also look to the continued ramp-up of new technologies supportive of ongoing AI momentum, and Xilinx integration as key focus areas for offsetting the near-term client segment slump."
4599370,2023-05-03,"AMD Q1 Results: Resilience Amid Challenges, AI Opportunity Takes Center Stage","Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. demonstrated resilience in Q1, beating revenue expectations and showcasing a robust AI portfolio. Q2 guidance, however, falls short of consensus projections, highlighting the need for caution and close monitoring. AI emerges as a significant growth driver for AMD, with the company well-positioned to capitalize on the rapidly expanding market."
4600196,2023-05-04,AMD: Time To Jump Ship After Q1 Earnings,"We maintain our sell rating on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. post Q1 2023 earnings results as we expect further downside risk ahead. We believe our differentiated investment thesis remains in play: moderating share gains coupled with a softening cloud/enterprise spending. AMD’s Q1 2023 results and FY23 outlook clearly confirmed our view of the weaker-than-expected demand environment in both the PC Client and data center end markets. AMD’s Q1 2023 PC Client sales declined 65% Y/Y and underperformed Intel Corporation, validating our view that AMD’s share gains against Intel have stalled. We recommend investors take profit on AMD stock at current levels, as we think there is further downside risk for the stock through the second half of 2023."
4599956,2023-05-04,AMD: The Bear Market Rally Is Over,AMD continues to underperform the semiconductors sector and the broader equity market once we adjust for risks. The latest quarterly report highlights some issues with profitability that were plain to see beforehand. The assumption that the large cloud providers will fill in the gap in client and gaming segments is way too optimistic at this point in time.
4599891,2023-05-04,Nvidia Vs. AMD - Who Will Win AI In The Short Run?,"Nvidia Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. are fabless chip designers that have been popular with the recent AI frenzy. I rate both Nvidia and AMD as Holds at current valuations. The AI frenzy has caused the stocks to trade at huge multiples, so buying is not recommended, but these are great businesses which I do not recommend selling. Both of these companies are releasing next-generation chips specifically designed for AI computing requirements. Despite AMD's innovative next-gen chip, it doesn't look set to dethrone Nvidia just yet."
4600627,2023-05-05,AMD: Game-Changing Rumors Fuel AI Comeback,"Advanced Micro Devices' Q1 earnings were recently reported and sent AMD stock spiraling downward. The very next day, a report came out citing Microsoft Corporation as working with and funding AMD's next-generation AI processors. Today the report was mostly denied, so focus on performance, while the rumor mill's timing is questionable."
4601495,2023-05-08,AMD: Reality Is Harsher Than It Seems,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. dip buyers returned in force last week, jumping on a media report that AMD could be working with Microsoft Corporation to build custom AI chips. Despite Microsoft's denial of AMD's involvement, it shows that the AI hype is well and alive, attracting buyers seeing significant potential. AMD has had much less traction against Nvidia Corporation in data center GPUs than its market share gains against Intel with its EPYC processors. AMD buyers must be cautious about adding too aggressively at the current levels, as its risk/reward remains well-balanced."
4601505,2023-05-08,AMD: Still Waiting To Buy,"The tailwinds provided to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. by the global chip shortage ended over a year ago. The company ramped up production during the shortage and has since throttled it back to allow time for the present backlog of inventory to diminish. AMD management is projecting that next quarter's revenue and operating margin will remain similar to the most recent quarters, yet expect operating expenses to drop to $1.6B. With a forward P/E of 161.66x, a forward PEG of 1.15x, and a forward Price/Cash Flow of 39.14x, AMD stock appears overvalued. I rate AMD as a Hold."
4602478,2023-05-10,AMD Is Ready To Set Sail Via AI Tailwinds,"Artificial intelligence requires an extraordinary amount of computing power and represents a long-term growth driver for AMD. Recent revenue/earnings contractions at AMD have been largely due to decreased PC demand. We see the pullback in EPS as an entry point opportunity for AMD shares. The Data Center and Embedded business segments at AMD represent areas of near-term and long-term revenue growth for the company. We remain """"bullish"""" on AMD with a conservative five-year price target range of $166 to $185. We currently own the stock in our Premier Growth & Ultra Growth portfolios."

4604510,2023-05-15,AMD: Expect More Difficulty,"AMD has seen its earnings drop substantially, as both margins and revenue have increased, having a dual impact. The company has a diverse portfolio of assets but it's facing rapid competition from other large tech companies starting to manufacture their own chips. Additionally, the potential for Intel to reach or surpass TSMC on process node leadership, could make AMD's ability to compete much lower. Overall, we expect more difficulty for AMD investors."
4605441,2023-05-17,AMD: Data Center Doom Scenario Unfolding,"Two years ago, the rumor mill informed us that AMD’s 3nm Turin EPYC would have 192 cores, or 256 cores for the dense version, obliterating Intel. The latest rumors indicate that Turin has been downgraded to 4nm, resulting in a heavy core count reduction from 192 to 128 (and to 192 for the dense version). Meanwhile, Intel has significantly upgraded its Granite Rapids specs with a new node and architecture, and potentially higher core count. Overall, this means the tide is quickly turning, with Intel returning to data center leadership sooner than expected (in Q3'24). These events are fundamentally based on TSMC struggling with N3 and N2, while Intel is retaking process leadership with its aggressive 5 nodes in 4 years strategy."
4605698,2023-05-18,Intel Vs. AMD: Preparing For A Cyclical Uptrend,"Intel expects a recovery in the second half of the year as they clear large excess inventories and release new PC and server products. Intel is implementing aggressive cost-saving measures to address the deterioration of its financial results. They reduced their dividend and are lobbying for government subsidies to cover their CapEx. AMD's forthcoming MI300 data center APUs are expected to compete with NVIDIA's offerings. AMD also expects a recovery in the second half of the year, with growth in Data Center revenue due to a new product line and improvements in the PC market. The semiconductor sector remains highly cyclical, and even though predicting the next uptrend is challenging, there are reasonable grounds to expect the uptrend to start in the year's second half and surge in 2024."

I will argue for a thesis to side with the Wall Street opinion. I see AMD troubles to be temporary, and the dominating forces to be in favor of AMD’s fundamentals. AMD's recent price breakout just adds a technical reason to be bullish."
4607964,2023-05-29,AMD: Don't Be The Last One To The Party,"AMD investors got a remarkable surge last week as Nvidia's robust guidance bolstered its AI tailwinds. However, AMD's leadership in data center GPUs is not close to Nvidia's dominance. Despite that, AMD is confident of gaining more share against Intel this year in the data center CPU business. Cloud service providers might also not want to put all their eggs in Nvidia, lifting AMD's Instinct GPU series. With the surge last week, investors have likely priced in the optimism. If you board now, you could be late to the party."
4608205,2023-05-30,AMD: Better Growth Runway Than Other Competitors,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. has strong long-term fundamentals and is well-positioned to gain market share in the AI industry compared to Nvidia Corporation and Intel Corporation. Wall Street rewards market share movement, and AMD has shown consistent improvement, which could lead to a bullish run in the stock. AMD is a better investment choice due to its longer growth runway, lower valuation multiple, and potential to gain market share in lower-priced AI-centric chips."

4666075,2024-01-30,AMD Is Dead Money (Rating Downgrade),"Going into today's Q4 2023 report, AMD stock is wildly overbought and could experience a correction in the absence of superlative forward guidance from management. While the stock has run up vertically in recent weeks, revenue and earnings estimates for Q4 have moved lower. That said, 2024 is expected to be a different story. Despite AMD's significant AI potential, its stock is priced for perfection (and more). At $177 per share, AMD's long-term risk/reward is unattractive. With AMD looking like dead money for the next five years, I'm downgrading it to a """"Sell"""" ahead of its Q4 2023 report."
4666337,2024-01-31,AMD: The 2024 AI Outlook Is Very Positive,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. updated investors about the outlook for its AI accelerators in 2024.

4679699,2024-03-21,AMD Stock Needs To Dip Lower Before I Buy,"At the time of writing, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. stock is in a 15% correction from its all-time high. Why it's correcting and should you buy the dip? Read on for my view. In the long term, I don't have enough evidence to question AMD's business growth. However, business growth is not the same as stock growth. As far as I see it, AMD appears to be overvalued by 11.3% from the current price even under one of the most optimistic assumptions regarding business growth. Perhaps buying the dip will make sense after a further 15-20% decline with fundamentals holding steady, but now it seems like a reckless idea to me. For now, I reiterate my previous """"Hold"""" rating for AMD stock."

In fact, AMD's operating income has been declining steadily over the past 3 years, while analyst estimates for future revenue and EBIT have plummeted. I argue that market participants have made a major mistake pumping up the stock; and, investors will now likely experience the correction of this mistake. On a technical level, AMD stock has already started to break aggressively, dropping close to 30% from all-time-highs made in early March this year. Looking at AMD's upcoming earnings release for the second quarter of 2024, I expect the sell-off to continue. My target price stands at $101."

AMD is well-positioned in the AI sector and could benefit from the industry's growth. AMD's stock appreciation should be viewed as a gradual process, and investors should expect periods of consolidation and pullbacks. AMD's stock has experienced a significant pullback, but it is expected to resume its long-term uptrend soon."
4691243,2024-05-09,AMD: The Gap With Nvidia Widens,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. continues to trail behind Nvidia in the technological race for AI chips, and its financial performance is disappointing across three out of four segments. The only segment which demonstrates solid top-line performance is Data Center, but its operating margin deteriorated significantly compared to early 2022. The management appears to lack a roadmap for handling the high inventory problem, and the sequential pace of inventory level decline in Q1 does not impress me. My target price for AMD stock is $117 per share, around 24% lower than the last close."
4695251,2024-05-24,AMD: Ride On Another Nvidia AI Surge (Rating Upgrade),"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. investors should consider riding on another beat-and-raise from Nvidia Corporation. Nvidia's strong AI read indicates more robust AI growth opportunities for AMD to capitalize upon. AMD's AI revenue guidance for 2024 is expected to be conservative, lowering its execution risks. AMD stock also seems to have bottomed in early May as buyers returned. I argue why it's time for me to turn bullish on AMD, looking to capitalize on another run toward its previous highs. Read on."
4696360,2024-05-29,AMD: Gaining Momentum In The Slipstream,"Advanced Micro Devices delivered weak overall performance in the first quarter earnings results, with lackluster forward guidance. The elevated valuation of AMD is sharpening the question regarding its growth prospects.

Despite AMD's significant decline - both on an absolute basis and relative to its main peer - I still see the risk of a further decline. AMD's seemingly cheaper valuation multiples are explained by lowered estimates for future earnings. I acknowledge the company's efforts to compete in the GPU market and provide formidable competition to its more successful rival, but the challenges I pointed out in my last article remain. AMD is a """"Hold"""" until I see Q2 numbers."

4702836,2024-07-08,AMD: Strong AI Tailwind Fails To Boost Overall Revenue Growth,"Despite 80% YoY increase in Data Center revenue, driven by strong demand for AI computes, the total revenue only grew 2.2% YoY in 1Q FY2024. Management expects a slower recovery in the Embedded and Gaming segments in FY2024 following nearly a 50% YoY revenue decline in Q1 FY2024, which continues to impact its revenue growth. A tailwind of gross margin expansion was largely offset by strong growth in SG&A expenses, resulting in a muted EBIT margin outlook. Despite anticipated earnings rebound in FY2024, AMD's non-GAAP P/E fwd remains high at 46.8x, comparable to NVIDIA's 47.3x, and it also sits 38% above the SOXX index. AMD stock appears overvalued, as supported by the increase in its valuation multiple alongside downward revisions in revenue and EPS in FY2024 and muted consensus in FY2025."
4703768,2024-07-12,AMD: Long-Term Implications Of The Silo AI Acquisition,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s acquisition of Silo AI is as strategic as they come. The gap with Nvidia won't close, but it'll eventually bring AMD that much closer to the competitor with a +10X market cap. It could also mean the beginning of a new stream of income from AI software deployments, bringing the company closer to its dream of being an end-to-end AI solutions provider. I'm recommending a Buy, but with the caution that the stock is likely to go through a quasi-cyclical growth pattern."

The premium doesn't seem justified as the company continues to struggle against Nvidia. The stock's likely overvaluation is evident from insiders selling throughout the last 12 months, including aggressive sales by the CEO in the past 6 months. AMD's performance across key P&L metrics in the next three quarters is expected to lag behind Nvidia, allowing Nvidia to amass more resources for increased R&D spending.

In this report, we preview AMD's Q4 2024 report and look at its updated long-term risk/reward."
4753256,2025-01-30,AMD: Why I Doubled My Position After DeepSeek Sell-Off,"AMD shares fell to a 1-year low this week due to DeepSeek's AI chat assistant news, but I believe demand for AMD's AI products will remain strong in 2025. I doubled my AMD position because the market is irrational and AMD is gaining ground in the AI accelerator market with surging Data Center revenues. AMD's aggressive AI investments are paying off, showing significant Data Center revenue growth, and the stock is trading at a near-50% discount to its historical P/E ratio. Despite DeepSeek's market impact, I remain confident in AMD's AI accelerators' demand, making AMD shares attractively priced amid recent downgrades."
4753957,2025-02-01,AMD: DeepSeek's Perceived Efficiency May Drive Demand For Cheaper AI Chips,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. has been overly sold off, attributed by its competitive AI accelerator offerings including Instinct MI300X, the upcoming MI325X, and MI350X. This is on top of the management's choice to undercut its direct competitor, as more hyperscalers utilize the Instinct series, no matter the impacted gross margins. These have led to AMD's AI accelerators offering a better price-to-performance ratios compared to Nvidia Corporation's, with these likely to be a boon after the recent DeepSeek revelation. These reasons are why we have cautiously upgraded the stock to a Buy, albeit with numerous caveats, partly attributed to the higher short interest volume on a YoY basis. For now, AMD's inherent undervaluation is compelling indeed, as we also buy into the recent dip, thanks to the more than doubling upside potential."
4754852,2025-02-04,AMD: Use This Buying Opportunity As The Market Overreacts,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is growing fast and trades below fair value. Reported strong results on Tuesday afternoon. The company did especially well in the data center market. Its Q4 earnings are growing fast while the valuation is low."

AMD is rapidly closing the performance gap with Nvidia, which should help the company improve its AI chip sales in the second half of 2025. Wall Street has clearly given a signal to hyperscalers in the recent correction that it would like a lower capex rate from these big tech companies. AMD could provide a better cost-performance metric compared to Nvidia, and it is starting from a very low base, which should help AMD deliver strong growth. AMD is trading at only 13.6 times the EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending Dec 2027, while the YoY EPS growth trajectory is very good, making the stock very attractive."
4773226,2025-04-06,AMD: The Market Hasn't Seen What's Coming,"AMD’s data center revenue nearly doubled in 2024, with over $5 billion driven by Instinct AI GPUs alone. The MI350X, launching in H2 2025, promises 35x inference performance over MI250, featuring 288GB of HBM3E memory. If AMD captures just 15–20% of AI inference market, it becomes a multi-billion-dollar second-source alternative to Nvidia.

4775817,2025-04-17,A Cautious Opportunity Emerges For AMD Investors,"AMD stock fell over 7% due to Nvidia's export restrictions to China, impacting AMD's AI chip sales and contributing to a ~26% YTD decline. The Company's forward P/E of ~19x for 2025 EPS offers a margin of safety, prompting an upgrade in the stock rating. Advanced Micro Devices' diversified revenue mitigates the impact of potential Chinese market losses. While cautious of industry cyclicality and competition, AMD presents an asymmetric investment opportunity with potential for significant upside and improved fundamentals."
4776096,2025-04-18,AMD: This Dip Is A Gift,"I reiterate my """"Strong Buy"""" rating for AMD, citing massive undervaluation and strong growth prospects in AI and data center markets despite recent stock underperformance. AMD's Q4 revenue of ~$7.6 billion and EPS of $1.09 beat expectations, driven by significant growth in the data center segment. The potential $800 million tariff-related charge is manageable, with AMD's diversification and strong AI and server market positioning mitigating long-term risks. Even under bearish scenarios, AMD is at least 25% undervalued, with potential upside of 70-75% as market conditions stabilize. Given all of the above, I don't call back my """"Strong Buy"""" for AMD today."
4776366,2025-04-20,AMD: Close To Buy Levels But Not There Yet - Reiterate Sell,"We downgraded AMD to a sell due to unrealistic AI growth expectations, and the stock has dropped almost 30% since then. New U.S. licensing requirements for AI chips, including AMD’s MI308, have led to an $800M write-down. We think this confirms our belief that AMD has an AI problem more than a China problem, although the latter makes up 24% of total sales as of 2024. Our belief (although we can't prove) is that AMD is writing off inventory that's not just strictly MI308. We think we're almost at buying levels, but see more downside into the end of the month as AI expectations reset, but the real next catalyst for AMD (PC Client) kicks in."

Key risks include geopolitical tensions affecting China operations, potentially impacting AMD revenue by $800 million due to export controls on advanced processors."
4776567,2025-04-21,AMD: Brace For A 10% Impact On EPS For FY 2025,"A 10% hit to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s EPS in 2025 is quite likely, yet the consensus on Wall Street has only priced in a 3% drop so far. To be specific, I believe the market is underestimating the risk of AMD’s $800M inventory charge if export licenses aren’t approved, which is a likely scenario. Another headwind includes the upcoming tariffs on semiconductors, which can range anywhere from 25% to 100%. AMD imports a significant amount of AI chips from TSMC. Currently, AMD's stock is at a critical price level, and breaking the historical upper trend since 2019 could lead to further downward pressure. I'm definitely staying on the sidelines. I would caution against buying the dip until earnings revisions catch up to the reality of these headwinds and tariffs on semis are clear."
4776496,2025-04-21,AMD: Buying Evidence Has Emerged (Rating Upgrade),"I am upgrading AMD to a Hold rating due to improved momentum indicators and a better valuation, offset by ongoing supply chain and Trump tariff risks. Lower share pricing has improved AMD's valuation, with EV to 2025 sales and EBITDA estimates at their most attractive levels since 2019, if not before. AMD's strong balance sheet and foothold in the AI-chip market make it a watchlist candidate for future buying opportunities. Evidence of accumulation on the trading chart has appeared since late February."

4779013,2025-04-29,AMD: Don't Give Up Yet,"The upcoming earnings of AMD will be crucial for the company in terms of forward guidance on AI revenue trajectory and the impact of tariffs. We could see AMD beat estimates for first quarter similar to Intel due to customers pulling ahead their purchases to prevent a tariff hit. AMD has stopped giving guidance for AI revenue, but the product pipeline is strong, and the company could still reach over $10 billion in AI revenue in 2025. There are multiple headwinds due to increase in custom chips and economic uncertainty, but AMD could improve its market share within AI chips. The stock is trading at only 16.1 times the EPS estimate for fiscal year ending Dec 2026 and 13.53 times the EPS estimate for fiscal year ending Dec 2027."
4779001,2025-04-29,AMD Q1 Preview: Inflection Point Approaching (Technical Analysis),"Trading patterns in the past 3~4 weeks suggest an imminent trend reversal for AMD stock prices. Technical indicators such as bullish crossover and rising RSI suggest increasing upward momentum and buying interest. I further expect AMD's upcoming FQ1 earnings report (ER, scheduled on May 6, 2025) to provide the trigger for such a reversal. I expect the ER to report profit margin expansion and continued growth in its key products."

Forward P/E compressed to 22x despite 30%+ projected EPS CAGR through 2026, signaling deep market undervaluation. Data Center revenue surged 94% YoY in 2024, driving 28% segment margins and hyperscaler demand for MI300X and EPYC. AMD’s forward PEG ratio stands at 0.78, far below ARM (2.13) and QCOM (1.78), despite faster growth potential. Free cash flow scalability is poised to inflect upward as AI and enterprise workloads shift toward margin-rich infrastructure."
4781191,2025-05-02,AMD: You May Not Get It This Cheap Again,"AMD stock has shown resilience, recovering over 30% from April lows despite trade war uncertainties and semiconductor tariffs. The data center business is crucial for AMD, contributing nearly 49% of total revenue, and is expected to maintain momentum despite potential CapEx reductions. AMD's valuation is attractive, with a forward EBITDA multiple of 21.2x, suggesting the market has priced significant risks against its cyclicality. I argue why we could be hard-pressed to ask for even lower valuation multiples as the stock continues its recovery. Investors should consider capitalizing on the current opportunity to buy more and avoid regretting later on."
4781075,2025-05-02,AMD: It Could Get Worse Before The Turnaround Occurs,"Advanced Micro Devices continues to lag behind Nvidia as the AI revolution moves onto the “agentic phase”, while a possible slowdown in hyperscalers’ CapEx plans ahead would particularly hurt AMD. 67% of CIOs seek to purchase “AI agents” from external software companies, benefitting rival Nvidia as it is the key technology provider to key players like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and others. AMD still doesn’t offer hardware systems that are optimized for “agentic AI”, missing the opportunity to serve the 27% of enterprises that are open to building their own “AI agents”. However, as agentic workloads shift from the cloud to on-device computing, AMD is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity through its “Client” segment, particularly the “Ryzen” AI chip for PCs. AMD’s Chief Technology Officer estimates that “killer apps” for AI PCs may still be 3–6 years away, undermining the sales growth prospects in the near future."
4781726,2025-05-05,AMD: Too Cheap To Ignore Before Earnings (Rating Upgrade),"AMD is massively undervalued and presents a compelling opportunity ahead of Q1 earnings, despite competitive pressure from Nvidia. AMD's earnings record is strong, with only one EPS miss in the last 12 quarters, and AI tailwinds are robust. Valuation analysis shows a fair share price around $150, indicating a 52% upside potential, even with conservative growth assumptions."
4782639,2025-05-06,AMD: Resilience In The Face Of Macro And Regulatory Adversity,"Technically, AMD is a broken stock. Fundamentally, AMD is in fine fettle. In its Q1 2025 earnings report, AMD showed strong performance with $7.44B in revenue, driven by Data Center and Client segments. Management's guidance for Q2 2025 suggests continued robust growth, despite macro and regulatory headwinds. Considering AMD's lucrative valuation, I rate AMD a """"Buy"""" in the $90s."

AI demand, new product launches, and easing China tariffs position AMD for potential outperformance. AMD's valuation at 18x, 2026 earnings suggests room for growth, with a potential rally if it clears the $115 resistance. The main risk remains the China trade war, but AI-driven growth could make AMD a top performer in 2025. Strong Buy rating."
4785545,2025-05-12,AMD: Strong Upside Potential If U.S.-China Trade Talks Turn Constructive,"AMD's 1Q FY2025 revenue topped the high end of its previous guidance, with strong margin expansion resulting in 55% YoY growth in non-GAAP EPS. The weak 2Q FY2025 outlook is largely impacted by the inventory write-off due to the MI308 chip ban in China. FY2025 remains a YoY growth rebound year, even considering the $1.5 billion revenue headwind from China, with Gaming and Embedded contributing positive YoY growth. AI data center demand remains strong, with AMD gaining CPU market share and beginning production of its fifth-gen EPYC at TSMC's new Arizona fab in April. The stock's valuation is attractive at 25x non-GAAP P/E fwd, nearly 50% cheaper than in my last analysis, supporting a Strong Buy as recent constructive trade talks could lift sentiment."
4786616,2025-05-14,AMD: Sell The Buyback News,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s strong rally doesn't justify its current valuation. Shares surged after a $6 billion buyback announcement, but the timing is odd given ample funds left on the current plan. Recent earnings were strong, with 36% revenue growth and a big Data Center segment boost, but future growth is expected to slow.
