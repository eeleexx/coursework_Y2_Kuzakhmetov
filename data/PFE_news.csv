The transaction is expected to create synergies resulting in nearly 30% earnings growth for the new company. Financial engineering through recapitalized balance sheets and multiple arbitrage will unlock additional value for shareholders. Both GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer are coming out ahead. GlaxoSmithKline is effectively splitting into two more focused companies while Pfizer is selling a non-core asset at a premium in a tax-advantaged spin/merge.
4233354,2019-01-14,Global Blood Therapeutics Continues To Build Strong Case For Successful Commercialization,"Company is guiding pre-NDA before end of Q1 2019 and will have more clarity on its confirmatory study design. Investors should be looking forward to the Q2 2019 top-line results from the full HOPE Study. There are additional 117 patients that will have their data presented. Commercialization plan is underway and GBT will be first to capture a $3-billion sickle cell disease market. Compassionate patients won't stop taking the drug, and these patients have been on drug for more than two years."
4233183,2019-01-14,Amgen And Pfizer: 2 Healthcare Companies We Want To Buy,"Healthcare is one sector I hope to add more of to our portfolio in 2019. Amgen's younger products have shown promising growth rates. The company's capital returns have been very generous in recent years. Pfizer's drugs, especially in the area of oncology, are performing very well. The company's dividend has grown by almost 8% annually over the past five years."
4234835,2019-01-22,Pfizer: Still A Cash Cow,Operational cash flows continue to increase. They continue to cover financing and investing activities. Remaining long.
4234704,2019-01-22,Pfizer Looks To Move Tafamidis Forward With Priority Review,"Pfizer announced that it had submitted both NDA applications to receive FDA approval for tafamidis to treat patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. The priority review designation was based on outstanding data in which tafamidis showed reductions of all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in a 30-month period. Alnylam and Ionis are two other competitors that have already received FDA approval for their drugs treating TTR amyloidosis. The meglumine form of tafamidis has a PDUFA date of July 2019, while the free acid form won't be reviewed until November of 2019. An analyst estimates that the tafamidis program could add 4% to the EPS of Pfizer."
4235596,2019-01-25,Arena's Deal With United Therapeutics Passes Regulatory Hurdle,"The HSR review on the Arena deal with United has passed, and the deal is now closed. Arena received its $800 million payment on January 24th. The deal also has $400 million in milestones and ongoing royalties."
4236122,2019-01-28,Global Blood Therapeutics: Investment Update And New Data Via Passionate-Use,"Investors in Global Blood have a lot to look forward to in 2019 with full phase 3 HOPE data and regulatory updates. With Voxelotor marketization slated for 2020, I anticipate Global Blood will see market success similar to Sarepta. Also discussed below, a recent article in Hematology provides interesting data on one patient who was administered Voxelotor via the passionate-use program. Global Blood remains a conviction buy heading into key events."
4236695,2019-01-30,Pfizer: Strong Buy Heading Into 2019,"Pfizer reported their fourth-quarter earnings for 2018 yesterday before the market opened, beating analyst expectations narrowly for both revenue and EPS. Poor guidance which fell below analyst expectations initially sent the stock down 2 percent, but shares quickly rebounded ending the day up by about 3%. The loss of patent protection for blockbusters Lyrica and Viagra is bad news, but Pfizer has weathered worse. I would look towards the future, Pfizer has a strong pipeline and positive catalysts in store for 2019. Pfizer anticipates buying back $9 billion dollars worth of shares all while making quarterly dividend payments of $0.36 in 2019."
4238396,2019-02-06,Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group's Late-Stage Pipeline Looks Well Positioned,"Pfizer has been investing heavily in establishing a competitive pipeline of innovative medicines.
         In-market and innovative brands have driven performance but face headwinds.
         The late stage pipeline looks good and is at position for maturity; 2019 readouts will be telling."
4239451,2019-02-08,Global Blood Therapeutics: A Crucial Year Ahead,Shareholders of Global Blood Therapeutics have had a wild ride since the stock came public several years ago. 2019 is shaping up to be a critical inflection year for the company as its main product candidate looks headed for approval before the end of the year. We revisited this promising developmental concern in the paragraphs below.
4240332,2019-02-12,2 Dividend Blue-Chips Set To Soar And 1 You Should Ignore,"Most investors are only looking to own 20 to 50 stocks in their portfolios, meaning you have to be selective with what you buy. Gilead Sciences is a pharma blue-chip with a relatively weak growth outlook that even from today's attractive valuation is likely to deliver merely bond like future returns. In contrast, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson are blue-chip SWANs with strong long-term cash flow and dividend runways and make far better buys today. From today's prices, JNJ is fairly value and likely to deliver about 10% long-term total returns. Pfizer is about 9% undervalued and likely to earn 12% returns over the next five years. That being said, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson still have their own risks that investors need to be comfortable with before buying them."
4241914,2019-02-18,Pfizer In NASH: Left Behind And The Desperate Refocus,"Pfizer is a proven pioneer of therapeutics for HIV infection, autoimmune, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases, as well as hematological and oncological ailments. At the end of Q4 2018, Pfizer reported a revenue increase of $274M, or 2%, compared to Q4 2017. Pfizer is progressing effectively in its NAFLD and NASH franchise pipeline, comprising diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase 2 inhibitor, acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor and a ketohexokinase inhibitor. In Q4 2018, Pfizer announced a non-exclusive clinical development agreement with Novartis for combination therapeutic approach to NASH. I do not visualize the clinical agreement as a game changer. For reasons which I elaborate on in text, its combination approach with in-house candidates are potential clinical successes."
4243756,2019-02-25,Street Bullish As Pfizer's Growth Is Set To Reaccelerate Beyond 2019,"Lyrica sales are expected to erode significantly over the next two years as generics enter the market. Pfizer’s pipeline has strengthened significantly over the last several months and has a number of opportunities that could offset these losses and drive mid-single digit growth in the coming years. Specifically, Ibrance, Xeljanz, Xtandi, Tanezumab, and Tafamidis represent significant opportunities that could drive growth for Pfizer."
4246335,2019-03-05,"With $1.3 Billion In Cash, Arena Poised To Move",Arena has $1.3 billion in cash. Arena's Ralinepag already in Phase 3. Arena's Etrasimod continues to demonstrate best in class characteristics.

4248546,2019-03-13,Pfizer: This Biotech Blue-Chip Offers Market-Beating Total Return Potential,"Pfizer is a Dividend Challenger that has raised its dividend each year since 2010 and was actually a Dividend Aristocrat before a dividend cut during the Great Recession. Despite the risks that accompany a pharma stock such as Pfizer, the company appears well-positioned to capitalize on its strong drug pipeline in the years ahead. Pfizer is currently trading at a 4% discount to fair value, making it a buy for income investors looking for a safe, growing dividend profile. The above factors make it likely that Pfizer will deliver market-beating annual total returns of 10.2-11.2% over the next 5-10 years."
4250617,2019-03-22,Pfizer Steps Further In The Door For Gene Therapies,"Pfizer takes 15% stake in privately held french gene therapy biotech Vivet Therapeutics, with the exclusive option to eventually acquire it. The first gene therapy product VTX-801 will be used to treat patients with Wilson's disease. Vivet Therapeutics has a large pipeline full of preclinical gene therapy candidates being developed to treat multiple types of rare liver diseases. Pfizer established a prior deal for a Hemophilia B gene therapy product candidate from Spark Therapeutics, which it has advanced in a phase 3 study."
4253754,2019-04-10,"Pfizer: Solid, Stable Returns","As of April 5, Pfizer Inc (PFE) shares closed at $42.99. Supported by large share repurchases, Pfizer share price has shown steady growth, from ~$25 in 2012 to the current level. The steady share price growth, and regular increasing dividend payments, have provided solid, stable returns for investors over the last 6 years. The only way an investor can realize a return from an investment in shares is through receipt of dividends, and/or gains on sales. I repeat - the only way. Analysts' Corner proprietary 1View∞Scenarios™ dashboards are used to assess whether investors in Pfizer can reasonably expect to enjoy returns in the future, similar to those available over the last six years."
4263786,2019-05-14,"Arena's Etrasimod Possesses Positive Attributes, But It Is Not Unique","Etrasimod has the potential to generate substantial revenues, but will likely face competition from similar S1P molecules. If a partner doesn't materialize, Arena has the means and willingness to advance etrasimod through FDA approval. Arena is likely to earn additional milestone payments and royalties from ralinepag, but timing remains uncertain."
4264284,2019-05-15,"Pfizer Acquires Therachon, Looks To Add To Rare Disease Pipeline","Pfizer acquires private biotech Therachon to gain a clinical product, known as TA-46, to treat patients with Achondroplasia. Pfizer paid an upfront payment of $370 million to acquire Therachon, with the remaining $470 million to be given as milestones are met. Before the transaction closes, Therachon is going to spin out its GLP-2 analog Apraglutide into a separate company which Pfizer will hold an investment on with its venture capital arm. Two competitors who are also developing a treatment for Achondroplasia are BioMarin and Ascendis pharma."
4264205,2019-05-15,Global Blood Remains On Track For Transformational Year,"Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) remains on track for Voxelotor commercialization in 2020.
         Investors can also anticipate eventual separation on vasoocclusive endpoint to rally shares.
         The company's under-the-radar licensing of inclacumab ""completes the package"", making Global Blood Therapeutics a force to reckon with in sickle cell disease.
         Shares of GBT remain conservatively valued and investors can anticipate further appreciation as this story plays out."
4265399,2019-05-20,"Pfizer Nabs Regulatory Approval For Tafamidis, An FDA First Is Achieved","Pfizer obtained FDA approval for drugs Vyndaqel and Vyndamax to treat patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. Vyndaqel and Vyndamax are the first drugs approved to treat ATTR-CM specifically, with potential competition in the future stemming from Alnylam and possibly Ionis with partner Akcea. Analysts estimate that Pfizer's drugs for ATTR-CM could generate as much as $2 billion in peak sales so long as a strong marketing plan and patient education are implemented successfully. Approval of tafamidis was given by the FDA on the basis of a positive phase 3 study, in which the drug proved to be stat sig over placebo in both all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations compared to placebo."
4265396,2019-05-20,"Pfizer: A 3.5% Yield, But Lyrica's Patent Loss Keeps Me From Buying","Pfizer Inc. is a global biopharma giant with a 3.5% dividend yield and a broad portfolio of therapies and consumer healthcare products. Pfizer has invested in R&D and made acquisitions to build a robust drug pipeline. The company has risks related to patent expiration and regulatory approvals. Pfizer's blockbuster drug, Lyrica, with over $5B in 2018 sales, will come off-patent in 2019-2020. The stock is overvalued at the current price."
4265581,2019-05-21,Pfizer: Added Value For A Defensive Pharma Portfolio,"Of the 6 largest pharmaceutical companies by market cap, Pfizer is the most balanced and with the shallowest patent cliff. Its best selling drugs are immune to political attack on pricing, and no single drug accounts for more than 12% of top line. After Lyrica, Pfizer has no significant patent expiration for the next 6 years. Dividends are the highest of the top 6, with the exception of AbbVie. Pfizer's net debt is close to zero, and a gigantic 20-year inverse head and shoulders pattern could break to the upside."
4265943,2019-05-22,"Pfizer Posts Positive Phase 3 Study In Eczema, Several Other Clinical Products In Place","Pfizer announced that it had achieved positive top-line results from its phase 3 study using abrocitinb to treat patients with atopic dermatitis (eczema). Top-line results showed that those treated with both doses of abrocitinib achieved both co-primary endpoints and all secondary endpoints with statistical significance compared to placebo over a 12-week period. Detailed results from the phase 3 study, known as B7451012, will be released at a medical conference and published in a medical journal later this year. PF-06700841 and PF-06651600 are two other clinical products in the pipeline that target a host of indications, specifically both are being developed to treat patients with alopecia areata which is a $12.99 billion market by 2026."
4266229,2019-05-23,Pfizer Has Limited Downside,10-year chart shows strong support for shares. 2019 earnings guidance was increased after the announcement of Q1 numbers. Volume continues to diverge from price in the daily and weekly charts.
4267133,2019-05-29,Pfizer And PF-05221304 In NASH: The Lead Clinical Asset,"One of Pfizer’s scientific forte is the clinical development of effective therapeutics for dyslipidemia, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders. PF-05221304, the lead investigative drug candidate, is an acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor currently in Phase 2a monotherapy and combination clinical trials in patients with NAFLD or NASH. Mechanistically, PF-05221304 is pharmacologically designed to suppress de novo lipogenesis leading to improvement in steatosis in patients with NAFLD or NASH. The top-line data readout for the Phase 2a monotherapy NAFLD and NASH trial is expected in late Q2/2019."
4269502,2019-06-10,Dividend Arbitrage For Pfizer,"Pfizer is set to undergo a strong June, as per its seasonal patterns. This stock has shown excess returns in good times and bad, also paying an above-average yield for the pharmaceutical industry. My discounted cash flow analysis puts the stock as fairly valued at $60 per share. I present a dividend arbitrage strategy for the next payout - a quarterly options strategy."
4270285,2019-06-14,Hold Pfizer: A Market Performer For Income,"Pfizer’s dividend has increased for 9 of the last ten years and presently has a high yield of 3.4%, which is well above average. Pfizer’s total return over-performed against the Dow average for my 54-month test period by 0.56%, which is all right. Pfizer’s three-year forward CAGR of 6% (S&P CFRA) is low and will give you slow growth as the United States and foreign economies grow. Pfizer’s cash flow is good and will allow the dividend to be increased, share buyback, and still have cash left over for new product development."
4270674,2019-06-17,Pfizer's Acquisition Of Array BioPharma: An Inevitable Deal,"Pfizer acquires Array BioPharma for $48 per share, which brings the value of the deal to $11.4 billion. The acquisition of Array gives solid drugs with a proven track record of sales like BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI, in addition to 30 ongoing clinical trials with massive expansion potential. Pfizer and partner Merck KGaA have seen hardship with Bavencio, which has been lagging behind in immunotherapy space, which is why I believe this acquisition of Array was inevitable. Before the acquisition of Array BioPharma, BRAFTOVI plus MEKTOVI surged with third-quarter 2019 sales of $35.1 million, which was a 54% quarter-over-quarter increase. The shift in focus for Pfizer has been primarily trying to enhance its oncology unit with acquisitions, which I believe has been largely accomplished after its latest buyout of Array BioPharma."
4270927,2019-06-18,"Global Blood Therapeutics' Data Falls On Deaf Ears, But Massive Potential Exists With Accelerated Approval Pathway","Global Blood Therapeutics obtains positive results from its phase 3 study using Voxelotor to treat patients with sickle cell disease. An NDA rolling submission to the FDA is expected to be completed by the 2nd half of 2019, with potential approval set for the 1st half of 2020. Voxelotor holds the potential to be a disease-modifying agent for patients with sickle cell disease; achieving an improvement in hemoglobin, anemia, and hemolysis. Inclacumab remains as another backup product in the pipeline, which is being used to treat sickle cell disease patients with vaso-occlusive crisis."
4270947,2019-06-19,Pfizer-Array Deal: Growth And Pipeline Addition,"Pfizer acquires Array in a +$11 billion deal. While very large in dollar terms, the deal is just a bolt-on deal for Pfizer, adding some growth potential and pipeline to the business. I see the rationale behind the deal as Pfizer could use some growth to create excitement."
4271453,2019-06-21,Biotech Acquisition Prospects As Handicapped By Market-Makers,"Pfizer $10 billion acquisition of Array BioPharma Inc. alerts markets to other candidates for industry contraction potential. Here are prospective price range forecasts for ten additional alternative candidates as evaluated by hedging deals to “fill” volume block trades. Along with comparative price range forecasts by MMs for Biotech ETFs and for the market-tracking ETF, SPY. The pleasant surprise here is that Arena Pharmaceuticals is a strong buy candidate without the need for any external attention."
4271909,2019-06-24,Pfizer: This Blue Chip DGI Name Strengthens Its Pipeline With Array BioPharma,"Pfizer is generally a fairly boring company. PFE shares offer a 3.4% dividend yield and relatively low volatility. On Monday, PFE management inked a $11.4b M&A deal that should bolster its already impressive pipeline."
4271817,2019-06-24,Pfizer: Array Deal Makes Sense,"Pfizer will strengthen its oncology portfolio through the Array acquisition, expected to be completed in H2-2019.
         At $48/share, the all-cash deal will be financed by debt and cash, putting the enterprise value of Array at $11.4B.
         The deal will be EPS dilutive due to additional opex requirement in an initial couple of years but is guided to turn accretive 2022 onwards.
         It is in-line with Pfizer’s inorganic expansion strategy and the valuation premium is in line with other acquisitions in the oncology space.
         The deal strengthens Pfizer’s presence and makes the stock worth a look, in our view."
4273292,2019-07-03,Global Blood Therapeutics: Voxelotor Can Take The Stock Price To New All-Time Highs,"The company reported positive Phase III clinical results of Voxelotor showing a significant hemoglobin improvement compared to placebo. We believe that, in the case of the FDA approval of Voxelotor, the stock price can reach $90 per share over the next 12 months. We find as the key risk for shareholders a potential excessive share dilution."
4273635,2019-07-05,Pfizer Remains A Strong Hold In Our Portfolio,Shares have had a strong few months. We still believe $44 is not fair value for this stock due to its strong technicals and earnings power. Strong dividend will continue to attract investors.
4273643,2019-07-06,Global Blood Therapeutics: Raining In The Desert With Voxelotor,"Raining over the barren desert of sickle cell disease, voxelotor demonstrated its prowess in the HOPE trial via improvement in hemoglobin, reticulocytes count, indirect bilirubin, and painful crisis. As the first of its kind, voxelotor modifies the disease course rather than conforming to the unrealistic expectation (i.e. a cure). In its whim, the market dismisses voxelotor's unprecedented progress. Contrary to the market, I strongly believe that voxelotor will gain FDA approval. As the upcoming standard of care for sickle cell, voxelotor will deliver hope to countless patients."
4273975,2019-07-08,Global Blood Therapeutics: My 3 Reasons For A Buy,"Global Blood Therapeutics reported encouraging Phase III results for Voxelotor in Sickle Cell Disease. I provide 3 reasons why I am buying the stock after the recent results. The stock has performed well over the past year, and the charts reveal a buying opportunity after the recent public offering. I discus my plans for entering a position and developing a long-term position in Global Blood Therapeutics."
4277571,2019-07-25,Pfizer Continues To Build Its Long-Term Potential,"Pfizer is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in an industry where size brings financial stability and the pockets to make blockbuster acquisitions. The company's acquisition of Array BioPharma adds R&D potential to an already strong pipeline that should see multiple blockbusters come to market over the next several years. Despite shares ascending to above $40, years of range-bound trading have resulted in the stock remaining attractively valued."
4278741,2019-07-29,Global Blood Therapeutics: A Promising Biotech Pick In 2019,"Voxelotor can prove to be a blockbuster opportunity. The drug has demonstrated superior efficacy as compared to placebo in HOPE trial. The company can sustain its operations for almost three years, without equity dilution. Certain risks must be considered prior to investing in Global Blood Therapeutics."
4278609,2019-07-29,The Totality Of Voxelotor Phase 3 Data Increases My Conviction In Global Blood Therapeutics,"I take a closer look into Global Blood Therapeutic's voxelotor phase 3 data in sickle cell disease as detailed by a recent New England Journal of Medicine article.
         Numerical reductions in bilirubin, vasoocclusive events, and reticulocytes, along with statistically significant increases in hemoglobin, suggest voxelotor safely improves hemolytic anemia.
         Theoretical safety concerns over voxelotor (tissue hypoxia & increased vasoocclusive events) are also put to rest, again.
         The totality of phase 3 data increases my conviction in voxelotor's potential to be disease-modifying."
4278954,2019-07-30,Understanding The Mylan-Upjohn Merger,"After some rumors surfaced during the weekend, Pfizer's Upjohn unit and Mylan effectively announced their merger today. While at first sight the 43/57 ownership split seems to be very generous for Mylan shareholders, it actually is only fair. However, the fact that Pfizer sees value in an asset hated by the market might change the narrative for the generics sector."
4278926,2019-07-30,Revisiting Global Blood Therapeutics,"Today, we revisit late-stage developmental firm Global Blood Therapeutics. The stock is down more than 10% since a recent secondary offering, but the company could see the approval of its Sickle Cell Disease drug candidate in 2020. We revisit this intriguing mid-cap biotech name in the paragraphs below."
4279750,2019-07-31,Mylan And Pfizer's Off-Patented Business: Tie-Up Of 2 Challenged Entities,"Mylan is merging its business with Pfizer´s off-patented branded and generic medicine business. Adding two challenged businesses together might not necessarily create a winner. I am somewhat cautious despite the low valuation and promise of synergies, as investors apparently have some reserves as well. I look forward to learning more about the pro-forma combination, but for now I am approaching this with a cautious stance."
4280149,2019-08-01,Pfizer Might Cut Its Dividend: 3 Things Investors Need To Know,"Pfizer is a defensive high-yield blue chip owned by millions of conservative income investors for safe and steadily rising dividends in all economic conditions.
         The Upjohn-Mylan merger will create a new non-patented drug focused company, given PFE $12 billion in cash, and turn Pfizer into a pure-play patented drug maker.
         Pfizer's higher margins and strong drug pipeline should make it one of the fastest-growing pharma blue chips over the next few years.
         But in the short-term PFE's dividend might have to be cut by as much as 20% and the newCo dividend might not be enough to compensate.
         PFE's historical fair value is $38, meaning there isn't much margin of safety buying today, though investors could still see 6% to 15% CAGR total returns. You need to decide whether that return potential and a potentially lower dividend compensates you for a higher risk profile seen with pure play patented drug makers."
4281534,2019-08-05,Pfizer: A Defensive Dividend Stock Even After The Spin-Off,"The Upjohn merger with Mylan has caused some uncertainty around Pfizer shares. However, I believe the dividend will likely by maintained. In this article, I explain why Pfizer is a good defensive stock to own for the next recession."
4281921,2019-08-06,I'm Lowering My Fair Value Estimate For Pfizer,"Pfizer just reported Q2 earnings, which included lowered top and bottom line guidance. The company is working on a restructuring plan that includes becoming more focused on its biopharmaceutical segment. I'm lowering my fair value target to $35/share."
4284829,2019-08-12,Pfizer's Dividend Confusion Is Likely To Create Opportunity,"Pfizer recently announced the spin-off of Upjohn, which manufactures Pfizer's off-patent drugs. The deal will bring in $12 billion. Pfizer also recently acquired Array for its biotech pipeline in a deal valued at about $11.4 billion. Pfizer is transitioning into a leaner company that will be more focused on the development of new blockbusters and which might be rewarded with a higher market multiple. Pfizer's dividend is likely to be reduced due to the spin-off, where the shareholders will receive shares of a NewCo that is likely to distribute the difference. Confusion over what Pfizer's actual dividend will be is creating uncertainty that is likely to be an investment opportunity."
4285036,2019-08-13,Merger Talk Boosts Pfizer,"Pfizer shareholders will end up owning 57% of the combined entity formed by merging Pfizer’s Upjohn unit with Mylan. Over the last number of quarters, we have expressed concerns about generic competition for some of Pfizer's older drugs and how the company could focus on the long-term growth drivers, while trying to squeeze the most out of the older products. The Mylan/Upjohn merger addresses those concerns, and now it will come down to execution, financial structure, valuation and capital return plans for shareholders to drive our decision on what we will do with shares of the combo."
4290440,2019-09-09,Global Blood Therapeutics: Stock Responds To Voxelotor Receiving Priority Review,"Voxelotor’s NDA was granted Priority Review status that cuts the FDA review time to six months. The PDUFA date is set for February 26th, 2020. I review Voxelotor’s regulatory designations and what these labels mean for Global Blood Therapeutics. Global Blood Therapeutics is preparing to “go-it-alone” in commercialization. I provide my three reasons why the company can handle the launch and won’t need a Big Pharma partner. I take a look at the charts to identify key areas for investors looking to start or manage a position following the recent catalyst."
4291292,2019-09-13,Pfizer Looks To Expand Market Opportunity For Its Blockbuster Drug Xtandi,"The FDA has accepted review of the sNDA for Xtandi to treat patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Xtandi was given Priority Review by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients, which will cut review time from 10 months down to 6 months. In Q2 2019 sales of Xtandi reached $201 million compared to $171 million in the same time period in 2018, which was year over year growth of 18%. Pfizer is looking to further expand the label for Xtandi, with the next target being to go after non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients."
4293615,2019-09-26,Recent Dip Presents Buying Opportunity In Arena Pharmaceuticals,"Stock is currently priced 33% below 52-week high. The most bearish trio analysts have Arena at a hold, while 4 analysts rate the company a buy or strong buy. Possible Etrasimod deal has potential to outdo $1-billion dollar Ralinepag deal."
4296171,2019-10-11,Pfizer's Push For Antisense Licensing Is Closely Aligned With Current Target Indications,"Pfizer announced that it had licensed the antisense drug AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx from Akcea with a $250 million upfront license fee. AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is being developed to treat patients with NASH, Type 2 Diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. Results from the phase 2 study using AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx to treat several of these metabolic indications are expected to be released by the first half of 2020. Pfizer had already been working on several of its own NASH drugs prior to the Akcea deal; in addition to a partnership it developed last year to test its NASH drugs with Novartis' tropifexor."
4296481,2019-10-14,Global Blood Therapeutics: A Core Biotech Buy For Patient Investors,"Shares have flat performance since my December 2018 update. I provide a recap of bullish thesis and recent events. Clinical evidence points to voxelotor being a disease modifying treatment for SCD, so approval could lead to it becoming the new standard of care. Valuation seems quite reasonable when utilizing $2 billion as a conservative peak sales number (cash position roughly equal to 25% of market capitalization). Global Blood Therapeutics is a Buy, a core-type stock that patient investors can accumulate dips on and hold with multi-year time frame. Risks include competition and further dilution in 2020."
4297723,2019-10-21,Pfizer: Avoid This High Yield,Pfizer trades at yearly lows after a 2019 EPS cut and the announced business combination with Mylan.

The primary endpoint of the study was met in those treated with Abrocitinib that had a higher IGA response of 43.8% compared to placebo with 7% from baseline to week 12. A competing drug for Pfizer in atopic dermatitis would be Dupixent; a phase 3 study with Dupixent as a comparator is expected to be read out by the first half of 2020. With positive results from several studies, Pfizer is likely to file its FDA application for regulatory approval of Abrocitinib in atopic dermatitis in 2020."

The global SCD market is expected to reach $5.5 billion by 2023. The company has another drug in the pipeline known as inclacumab which is being developed to treat those sickle-cell disease patients who have vaso-occlusive crisis. A competitor for Global Blood Therapeutics in this space would be Novartis, who recently received its own FDA approval for the treatment of sickle-cell disease patients with vaso-occlusive crisis known as Adakveo."
4309204,2019-11-26,"Pfizer: Grab The Popcorn, Wait And See",Pfizer has been losing patent protection of its star drugs and hence sales have been falling.

4310122,2019-12-02,Global Blood: Beware Of This Key Investment Risk As Voxelotor Enters Commercialization,GBT investors should be informed of a decades old generic which reduces crises in sickle cell disease patients by 46-60% while costing just $2 per capsule. Voxelotor reported no significant differences during clinical trials between its treatment arm and placebo in reducing the number of vaso-occlusive crises. The total address market for SCD may be limited due to the superb efficacy of Droxia and its low cost.
4310396,2019-12-03,Global Blood Therapeutics: Oxbryta Is Aimed For Success,"GBT announced that the FDA approved the first and only oxygen-affinity modulator (i.e., Oxbryta) for sickle cell disease. Due to its stellar efficacy and excellent safety profile, I believe that Oxbryta will become a blockbuster. But the sales ramp-up will be steady. Though there are hurdles to commercialization, there is an extremely robust demand for Oxbryta in a $3B market."
4312824,2019-12-16,Pfizer: A New Science-Based Pharma Wonder,"Pfizer took a huge price drop at the end of July after the company announced the divestment of the Upjohn unit. Upjohn unit divesting could bring value to the company in the long term, since a company focused on its core activities is more attractive to investors. Pharmaceutical companies that performed unit divestitures in the past had increased their stock price value. (When excellent strategy execution followed the divestiture).

Much of the treatment talk has been about Gilead's remdesivir, and Feuerstein - who has been at the center of much of the reporting - takes us through those ups and downs. Gilead reports after the close on Thursday. It's possible that alongside, the company might publish and discuss results from one of its remdesivir trials. Results from the most important study - the one being done by the U.S. government - are expected in mid-May. Even if all goes great with remdesivir, it's only a treatment, and will only be effective on certain patients. The world ultimately needs a vaccine, and vaccines take time - 12-18 months in a best-case scenario."
4343288,2020-05-05,"Pfizer: With Or Without A COVID-19 Vaccine, The Stock Is A Buy","Pfizer, along with every major healthcare company, is racing to produce a COVID-19 vaccine. While I would be thankful for a vaccine, I remain skeptical about the timelines suggested by any of these companies. Yet, with or without a COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer is an all-weather superior stock that deserves a spot in your portfolio because of its superior dividend, quality, value, and momentum. If you haven't yet capitalized on owning Pfizer with a yield above 4%, you still have the opportunity to do so."
4349376,2020-05-21,Pfizer: A Post Spinoff Dividend Growth Opportunity,"Pfizer, a former dividend aristocrat, has shown slow growth of key financial metrics over the last decade partly due to problems integrating acquisitions and restructuring costs. Pfizer is planning to merge its Upjohn business with Mylan, which faces challenges due to competition for one of its key products and restrictions to the Chinese generic drug market. Conversely, Pfizer's biopharmaceutical group has experienced solid growth over the last few years, thanks in part to their solid oncology, vaccine, and internal medicine division. Taken together, the consolidated Pfizer after the split will focus on its global biopharmaceutical group, which could offer a potentially appealing dividend growth stock for investors."
4351039,2020-05-30,Pfizer: Set Limit Orders No Higher Than $33.94,"The Upjohn split-off will be happening at some point in the second half of 2020, unhampered by COVID-19. Generics businesses command high margins, so even at lower multiples their valuations are significant, so we estimate the fair value of the Pfizer net of Upjohn. On the day of the split-off, we would not buy Pfizer if shares are not below $33.94. At that price, we think that Pfizer is an attractive income pick; if volatility allows entry at a lower price, we get the holy trinity of income, value and quality."
4355806,2020-06-26,Pfizer Is A Buy Now,Pfizer's current market price of around $32 is very attractive for long term investment. Pfizer shares are evaluated to include $2 towards the Upjohn unit at the current low prices. Pfizer is a growth play going forward. The 4.7%+ dividend yield at current prices is very attractive for a growth company.
4356124,2020-06-29,Pfizer: It's A Whole New Ballgame,Pfizer is in the midst of three deals that will transform the company into one that is focused on R&D for prescription medicines. Pfizer is yielding over 4.7% but the dividend may be reduced after Upjohn is divested. The new Pfizer will be positioned for higher growth and margins and potentially dividend growth. Pfizer will likely have a stronger balance sheet and lower leverage after Upjohn is divested.

Reasons for caution about success because coronaviruses have proved resistant to vaccine solutions. None of the criteria for a successful vaccine yet satisfied. More than 22 candidate vaccines on a fast track in humans and 100 more in development; all are at a very early stage. Meanwhile social distancing, lots of testing, tracking and quarantine are currently the only tools available to contain the virus. Investors should be cautious in assuming a successful COVID-19 vaccine will be developed any time soon."

New research published in the journal Nature may partly explain the much lesser burden placed on China by COVID-19: Long-lasting T cell immunity stimulated by prior exposure to the virus that caused SARS in 2003 (source: Le Bert et al., Singapore). Not only was the US less prepared strategically for this virus to arrive, its populace may have been less prepared biologically. Absent natural immunity via prior coronavirus exposure, vaccines that result in long-lasting T cell immunity are in the interest of national security."
4368366,2020-08-13,Why Pfizer's 4% Yield Is Your Best Covid-19 Vaccine Play,"I demonstrate why Pfizer is the best choice for dividend investors playing the Covid-19 vaccine theme.

It is evident in both the data and my personal experience that Oxbryta is being welcomed by patients and hematologists, alike, with open arms. Entry into the younger market and full approval is sure to accelerate revenues. I find this outcome to be likely. Stock in Global Blood Therapeutics has yet to realize the full potential of Oxbryta. Investors still have time to join in this story and reap rewards."
4370079,2020-08-21,More Pfizer/BioNTech Data On Their Actual Vaccine Candidate,"Pfizer/BioNTech released more data about their actual coronavirus vaccine candidate, BNT162b2. And it seems pretty clear why they went with it as opposed to the previous candidate, BNT162b1. Overall, the ""b2"" vaccine produced fewer reactions on injection, and milder systemic reactions such as fever, body ache, etc. The antibody response in the two vaccines was quite similar, and they both showed the same trends."

4376956,2020-09-30,Pfizer's Vaccine Portfolio To Benefit From Co-Circulation Concerns,"Pfizer’s recent successes in pushing forward a COVID-19 vaccine are taking center stage, but we think business opportunities also lie with their existing vaccine portfolio. People are concerned about their general immunity while COVID-19 co-circulates with other infections, hence leading to a rise in vaccine demand. Although the efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine remains uncertain, that COVID-19 is a tailwind for the existing portfolio seems to be overlooked, and could eventually push the valuation upward. We think Pfizer is an unusually good opportunity given market valuations and business resilience."

What might have been an episode focusing on the ramifications of last week's elections instead was dominated by Monday morning's vaccine update. Martin reminds that the Pfizer news might not be the golden bullet that ends the pandemic, and suggests the market - the Dow up 5% at the time of recording on Monday - may be over-reacting. Treasurys are trash, says Martin, and investors in search of yield should look to safe dividend plays - there are plenty out there with perhaps better credit than the U.S. Treasury. Last week's elections bode well for potential federal de-criminalization of marijuana, but Martin would stay away from the commodity growers. Instead look for those companies that might benefit from the consumer product angle."

It has been subjected to an unwarranted selloff due to a slower than expected commercial launch despite the fact that this is likely a short-term impact due to COVID-19. With management making an effort to make physicians more aware of Oxbryta and to increase coverage of Oxbryta, the long-term growth trajectory of Oxbryta should not be affected. Currently, GBT trades at an incredibly conservative multiple of just $2bil EV despite being a market leader in a sector estimated to be worth at least $28bil."
4390798,2020-11-21,Pfizer: Upside From COVID-19 Vaccine Could Dissipate,"When PFE announced its vaccine was effective at treating COVID-19, it was the shot heard around the world. Broader markets rallied on the prospects that the economy could reopen sooner than anticipated. A vaccine is particularly important for stocks related to travel, leisure activities and transportation. A vaccine could represent about 10% PFE's total revenue and would likely fall over time as competitors enter the market. The upside from the vaccine is likely priced in. PFE is a hold."
4392067,2020-11-30,Pfizer: A 'New' Growth Foundation In Genomic Medicine,Pfizer has been working on New Pfizer for almost a decade. The spin offs of Consumer Health and Upjohn appear to be the last steps. Continuation of the policy of dividend growth is a stated priority. Biopharma led by scientific pipeline innovation is expected to generate $15 billion in new product revenue through 2025. Gene therapies led by three late-stage programs have favorable approval probability and are followed by 10 preclinic programs. Pfizer is scheduled to provide an update on their three late-stage gene therapy programs at ASH in December which could be a price catalyst.
4393071,2020-12-04,Murphy's Law Applies To Pfizer,"PFE announced it planned to ship less of its COVID-19 vaccine in December due to supply chain constraints. PFE's manufacturing process seems to be delicate. The situation proves that ""if anything can go wrong, then it will."" Any missteps by PFE could open the door for MRNA (or others) to fill that void.

It is unclear whether vaccines from PFE, MRNA, NVAX, or JNJ can protect against the new strain. If a vaccine emerges to treat the new coronavirus strain, then it could shake up the $39 billion market. Shares of several vaccine makers are under pressure. PFE remains a hold."

The value is mostly in Etrasimod - a new type of treatment for immune related diseases such as Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's Disease, and Atopic Dermatitis. Shares dropped in November as Etrasimod failed to achieve its primary endpoint in AD - but analysis suggests that may have been down to a trial mishap. The company will push ahead with a pivotal trial in AD, and UC - and these are huge markets worth ~$40bn. If the promise of S1P Receptor Modulators shows up in late-stage trials, ARNA could have a blockbuster drug on its hands, and a valuation &gt;$150 per share, in my view."

Pfizer's price is only slightly above the most bearish analyst twelve-month forecast. Pfizer's unpopularity stems from investors' desire for positive skewness.
4399482,2021-01-18,Pfizer: Weak Full-Year Earnings Estimate Hurts The Bull Case,"Analysts were disappointed by PFE's 2021 earnings projections. I believe PFE must cut costs now that it has hived off Upjohn. Operation Warp Speed delivered a COVID-19 vaccine, yet the rollout has been slow. Bottlenecks in PFE's supply chain could further hurt its ability to get the necessary doses to the masses. PFE remains a hold."

4404923,2021-02-10,Look For A Bounce In Pfizer After 2-Month Pullback,"Pfizer stock fell after the earnings report fell short of estimates. Revenue has declined in the past several years but is now rising. Additionally, Pfizer has a low P/E ratio. Pfizer's 50-week moving average is just below the trend line at $34.01, giving the stock two layers of support in the same area. Revenue growth, RoE, profit margin, and dividend yield for Pfizer are on the rise. Pfizer is projected to be setting up for a bullish run."
4404303,2021-02-11,Pfizer: Buy It For A Safe 4% Plus Dividend Yield,Pfizer offers an attractive dividend yield and a conservative P/E ratio.

4408574,2021-02-24,12 Reasons Novavax Beats Pfizer For Titles Of Best Covid Vaccine And Best Covid Vaccine Stock,"The Novavax Covid vaccine has the highest efficacy against the original Covid-19 strain and the South Africa variant. It is also the only vaccine with proven efficacy against 3 variants. It is the only major Covid vaccine that can easily be made into a multivalent vaccine that contains multiple variants in a single dose. It also has the highest manufacturing capacity, the most geographically-diversified production and the highest quality group of partners. These and its many other advantages make it the top vaccine, will allow it to charge a premium, and will give it the largest share of the long-term market. While Pfizer has a very good vaccine and is a solid buy, Novavax is very undervalued with high upside, making it a strong buy."
4408976,2021-02-25,"Forget Pfizer Stock, Buy Historically Cheap Call Options","Implied Volatility in the 3rd percentile is at the same level as it was before the Covid-19 vaccine. Volatility spikes driven by news aren't priced in. Options volatility is also skewed negative and pricing in a $0.10 drop. Historically, this marks great buying opportunities as investors are over bearish. The recent earnings report was a flop, but some tension has been released as we now know that the dividend after the Viatris spinnoff won't be meaningfully impacted. Gaining exposure by buying call options gives us leveraged upside while limiting any catalyst driven downside risk as options premiums will rise with volatility."

4415526,2021-03-23,Pfizer: Ultra-Cold Storage Of COVID-19 Vaccine No Longer Required,"The FDA no longer requires PFE to transport vaccines at ultra-low temperatures. The decision could improve PFE's supply chain, positioning the company to better compete for market share in 2022. PFE's Q4 revenue grew 12% Y/Y. Management expects 6% long-term growth ex-COVID-19 vaccine. At 28x earnings, I rate PFE a hold."

4417655,2021-04-05,Pharmaceutical Company Pfizer Dividend Growth Investing Results,"Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have earned much news lately due to their successful warp speed COVID-19 vaccine development. This article updates my 2016 article on the PFE holding I initiated in 2001. I am committed to dividend growth investing (DGI) and started PFE acquisitions two decades ago because its dividend growth record appealed to me. PFE’s long-term dividend growth has been consistent except for an unexpected one-time 50 percent dividend rate cut in 2009. Despite the cut, dividend rate raises and reinvestment have boosted my PFE dividend payout growth and enabled cumulative dividends to approach my original purchase cost."
4417793,2021-04-06,Pfizer: Why It's An Easy High Conviction Buy,"Pfizer projects approximately $15 to $20 billion in 2021 revenue from the vaccine. Investors appear to view the spike in vaccine revenue as a one-time event. However, there are reasons to believe vaccine revenues could continue. Even without the vaccine, Pfizer has a solid growth profile."
4417708,2021-04-06,Pfizer: COVID Vaccine And Beyond,"Pfizer owns one of the best COVID vaccines that will boost its revenues by quite a lot in 2021, but there is more to like beyond that. Pfizer has some attractive assets in its pipeline and offers a very solid dividend yield of more than 4% right now. On top of that, Pfizer is historically inexpensive, which may indicate a good buying opportunity."
4418651,2021-04-12,Pfizer: Monumental Share Float Flattens Growth Prospects,"Pfizer is the world's second largest pharmaceutical company by market cap - currently $202.5bn - and has led the way in COVID vaccine development over the past year. Besides its vaccine, growth across the rest of the company's portfolio of drugs has been flat for the past 3 years. Having opted to spin out its Upjohn generics business into a new JV with Mylan, Pfizer's revenues have shrunk by $10bn, to $42bn in FY20. The company pays a generous dividend yielding ~4.3% but its huge share float makes its share price immobile, in my view. Although the business could be valued at >$41-$54 per share using financial modelling, the share price is unlikely to meet the midpoint of this forecast. Buying the stock is similar to buying a fixed income security."

Shortly after Oxbryta's approval, I decided to book some profits and sock drawer the rest of the position. The recent sell-off has enticed me to change my strategy.

Pfizer has a cooperation with Arvinas, which the latter shows may deliver another $802 million potential revenue.  Little has been said about this cooperation since its announcement. Arvinas is a pioneer in using targeted protein degradation to cure various maladies.  Pfizer and their Covid vaccine partner BioNTech know all about the proteins involved in SARS CoV-2. On May 19, 2021, the CEO of Arvinas competitor Progenra (private) gave a talk on using protein degradation for SARS-CoV-2. So protein degradation is definitely on the radar for SARS-CoV-2."

4432124,2021-05-30,Pfizer: mRNA COVID Vaccine Is Transforming And More To Come,"mRNA vaccines are a revolution because they allow rapid vaccine development and scale-up of manufacture. mRNA technology is about tricking humans to make proteins; there will be other applications beyond vaccines. Pfizer’s partnership with BioNTech leads the pack on technology, commercialisation, and global delivery capacity. The mRNA COVID vaccine is now Pfizer’s major product and its value will increase substantially; this makes Pfizer an interesting investment from both likely capital gain and stable dividend perspectives."

While the Covid-19 vaccine is less important itself for profits, the R&D effort and the messenger RNA give the company great option value. The political environment will always be tough for Big Pharma, but Pfizer is getting focused and can offset its patent cliff. The patent cliff seems to be weighing too much on sentiment but the Covid-19 vaccine should see ‘durable demand’ beyond the immediate crisis."

After an expected surge in sales and profits as a result of the pandemic, the company is expected to report declining figures for the better part of the next decade.

Long-term, learnings from their vaccine research will help develop future products, particularly in immunology and oncology. The company expects adjusted diluted EPS of ~ $3.60 for a P/E of 10.82 at the current price of $38.98. The $1.56 dividend yields 4.0%."

Two developments to broaden the COVID program involve a 3rd booster shot and new version to protect against the delta strain of SARS-C0V-2. Broadening the mRNA vaccine program to include influenza will show how revolutionary the mRNA vaccines are. With ~$26 billion out of $70.5-72.5 billion of Pfizer’s 2021 guidance due to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine likely to be an underestimate, Pfizer looks interesting for investment."
4438724,2021-07-12,Pfizer Shares Likely To Get A Boost In The Second Half Of 2021,"Pfizer appears likely to break out of its multi-year trading range. Pfizer's exposure to the Covid-19 vaccine appears underappreciated, which is likely to correct in the second half of 2021. The market is pricing in no need for vaccine boosters, but I believe boosters will become suggested for at least those above a certain age and/or compromised immune systems. Pfizer's strong cash position provides a margin of safety and gives the company the ability to pull off various financial levers, including buybacks, a special dividend, and acquisitions. An accelerated repurchase of shares and/or a special dividend appear probable within 2021."
4439978,2021-07-19,Pfizer: The Wildcard,"Based on a forecasted annual return of 3.2% and risk of 12% through 2026, Pfizer is a Hold. Pfizer’s primary source of risk is operational: $18-20B per annum lost revenue starting 2026. COVID vaccine performance and operations metrics suggest Pfizer is an ideal partner. Partnerships and acquisitions will likely mitigate the patent cliff. Replacing lost revenue is an idiosyncratic risk and diversifiable."

As a result, PFE currently trades at a price-to-sales ratio of just 3x and a price-to-earnings ratio of 10.8x (both FWD), making it one of the cheapest of its peers. Given the recent news, Pfizer seems well-positioned to make up for a missed rally. In the last 8 years, Pfizer has only twice missed Q3 analyst forecasts.

Pfizer’s Paxlovid treatment pill has a 10 million dose order from the US Government for $5.29 billion in 2022 (subject to approval) and this is just the start.

Some analysts believe Pfizer can earn revenues >$100bn next year thanks to $29bn of Comirnaty revenues, and $24bn from Paxlovid. That's close to 100% organic growth, which is unprecedented - it's no wonder PFE stock price has finally woken up - but is there further upside?

Paxlovid looks to have the most effect where you'd want it the most, in patients who are at high risk of bad outcomes. Pfizer's data look strong, and one would expect a quick regulatory approval. One hitch is that the drug is given along with Ritonavir, which is not in there for its antiviral activity (it has no antiviral activity against the coronavirus), but for its well-known ability to inhibit drug-clearing metabolic enzymes in the liver."

The stock is up >50% since June, and many analysts believe Pfizer can target >$100bn of revenues in 2022 - up from $42bn in FY20. That is staggering growth, but Pfizer will need its M&A deals to come off if it to keep growing long term, and not collapse if - as expected - COVID revenues fall fast in a BAU environment. The Arena deal is likely the first of many, and the lead asset Etrasimod may be a $5 - $10bn peak sales opportunity - it's a good start and a matches the COVID era change of pace by mgmt."

The cash-rich Pfizer has also embarked on intensive research and development and multiple acquisitions to bolster its impending patent cliff in 2025. Moving forward, the future never looked brighter for Pfizer as it expands its pipeline after divesting the off-patent business, Upjohn, in 2020.

If Pfizer develops products using Codex' platforms and tech the $270m market cap biotech could potentially earn hundreds of millions in milestone payments. The most interesting part of the deal may be that it signals Pfizer's intent to develop mRNA medicines - rivalling the likes of Moderna & partner BioNTech. Codex offers industry leading turnaround times, IP protection, and an experienced management and highly skilled staff. Perhaps an ideal M&A proposition for Pfizer. This minor deal could blow up into something much bigger for both companies - it could be transformative for Codex's share price in 2022, although nothing is guaranteed."

The US government also doubled its order to 20M courses for the treatment. Based on Advance Purchase Agreements of 24.27M courses of Paxlovid as of December 2021, PFE will report an additional revenue of $12.94B in FY2022. PFE will also report a revenue boost from Comirnaty sales, as more countries such as European Commission increased their orders for FY2022. We discuss whether investors should add PFE stock now."

Forget “herd immunity” and get used to ongoing need for new vaccines. Pfizer’s Plaxovid pill treatment is the best early stage treatment and it will contribute strongly to 2022 performance of Pfizer, but long term role for Plaxovid is less clear. Vaccination has been redefined and its scope and scale is just becoming clear. It is key to addressing the COVID pandemic and other diseases.

Despite partnering with BioNTech on Comirnaty, Pfizer appears to be exploring its options and working with other partners, including Codex DNA, and now Beam Therapeutics. Pfizer has paid Beam $300m upfront and the deal could be worth >$1.3bn if all milestones across three programs are met. Beam is a highly promising biotech combining CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing with its own base editing technology. By investing in Beam, Pfizer gives itself a chance to marry gene therapy, mRNA science, and the latest drug delivery software and target multiple therapeutic fields. A successful partnership could see Pfizer establish itself as world's premier pharma."

Omicron is less dangerous for lung damage (hospitalisation and death) but there is little information about how Omicron impacts long COVID. Vaccines are a key tool in defence against COVID. Whether it be 4th booster dose, new Omicron vaccines or more generic COVID vaccines, new COVID vaccines are still coming. The mRNA technology makes possible rapid and targeted vaccine development. It also revolutionises all vaccine developments. Pfizer’s partnership with BioNTech and huge development and execution on vaccine developments is a major commercial asset which will drive Pfizer’s business into the future."
4485126,2022-02-08,Pfizer Vs. Merck: Battle Between The Giants During Pandemic And Beyond,"Though Pfizer and Merck successfully developed their own COVID-19 anti-viral therapeutics, their similarities ended there. Pfizer's Paxlovid is clearly superior at 89% efficacy, boasting more than double Merck's order book. Despite the robust sales for Comirnaty and Paxlovid, Pfizer is still facing a patent cliff from FY2024 onwards, with a potential loss of $22B annual revenues. On the other hand, Merck has managed to extend Keytruda's patent by eight years, which may account for an additional $137B of revenues from 2028 to 2036. Moving forward, Merck is expected to report decent growth at a CAGR of 3.93% over the next five years, while Pfizer's revenue will return to its pre-pandemic stagnation."

The company was able to report growth for its flagship product, Oxbryta, in the face of COVID-19 headwinds. The company recently reported mixed earnings and revealed a hefty cash position. Global Blood Therapeutics revealed that Oxbryta received approval in the EU. The company now has several growth opportunities. The share price has chopped around for the last 7 months, as a result, I am looking to change up my strategy to a hybrid approach.

Furthermore, its COVID-19 pill Paxlovid could be a critical lever in FY22 as we move into an endemic COVID world. We discuss why PFE stock is in the Buy zone."
4495711,2022-03-15,Pfizer: Strong And Stable Profit Drivers,"Pfizer is a great business that is currently trading at a discount of about 10%. It earns a very competitive return on capital employed, and a fundamental DuPont analysis shows its potential to further expand the ROCE. In the long term, it presents excellent prospects for double-digit return potential with a wide margin of safety and excellent financial strength. In the near term, COVID-19-related sales from Comirnaty and potentially Paxlovid could provide growth catalysts."
4497821,2022-03-25,"Pfizer: Revenues May Reach $100bn In 2022, But The Halo May Be Slipping","Pfizer had a stunning year in 2021, driving revenues by 92% to $82bn, and things are forecast to get even better in 2022, with revenues potentially rising >$100bn. That is thanks to Pfizer's COVID vaccine Comirnaty, and its COVID antiviral Paxlovid, which are expected to earn >$55bn between them this year. But what happens after that? There is not a lot in Pfizer's product portfolio or pipeline to make up for lost COVID vaccine and therapy revenues in a post-pandemic environment. Pfizer's top line revenues could shrink to not much more than $50bn - similar to Bristol Myers Squibb - whose market cap valuation is half that of Pfizer's. Pfizer wants to pivot and become an MRNA / vaccine giant, but that may not be as easy as management seems to believe. The apparent lack of a coherent plan going forward makes me nervous and a little bearish."

Pfizer’s earnings from Comirnaty continue to distort the price of Pfizer stock; this will continue. The more difficult issue is to understand what impact beyond Comirnaty the mRNA vaccine technology will have on Pfizer. Pfizer has massive cash for new investments. Pfizer’s future looks robust."
4499173,2022-04-01,Pfizer: How It Could Double,"Since my report on 10-18-21, consensus earnings estimates for Pfizer have risen 94% and 57% for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Growth estimates are now materially higher through mid-decade. After rallying 50% in just two months following my last report, Pfizer shares have now returned 29% compared to 3% for the S&P 500. The question: can the outperformance continue? While sales and earnings estimates have exploded to the upside, Pfizer’s valuation multiple remains unchanged at a mere 12x the 2024 consensus EPS estimate and 7x the 2022 estimate. The company generated an incredible $30 billion of free cashflow in 2021 and may materially surpass this in 2022. Pfizer is now embarking on a historic growth investment cycle at a technological inflection point for biotechnology, making it a profoundly asymmetric opportunity."
4501041,2022-04-12,Global Blood Therapeutics: Hitting A Growth Inflection,"Global Blood Therapeutics is enjoying strong fundamental improvement amid the biotech bear market.

4501141,2022-04-13,Pfizer's Vaccine-Plus-Treatment Strategy For RSV,"Pfizer is developing a vaccine-plus-treatment strategy beyond its COVID programs. Pfizer has an RSV vaccine program well advanced and it has announced acquisition of ReViral to include RSV treatment along with a vaccine approach. Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine partnership with BioNTech is growing with a fourth mRNA vaccine program on Shingles, in addition to two influenza and the COVID programs. The above developments start to make clear how Pfizer plans to show that the COVID business involving partnered mRNA vaccine, plus in-house oral treatment, is part of a broader strategy. I remain optimistic about Pfizer’s future plans."

The deal is worth $11.4bn, and the peak sales potential may be as high as $6bn, analysts believe. Meanwhile, Pfizer's Q122 revenues were $25.7bn, and the company looks on track to surpass $100bn of revenue in 2022. Management has been cagey about discussing 2023 guidance - understandable, given its COVID vaccine revenues will likely shrink significantly. CEO Albert Bourla has been making acquisitions in good areas with the COVID cash and suggesting he can find $25bn of additional top line revenues by 2030 - if he does, Pfizer's share price can hit new highs."
4518371,2022-06-14,Pfizer: The Pain Might Not Be Over,"This is a dedicated price action analysis of Pfizer stock. We discuss the critical levels investors should observe carefully to help with their investment decisions. Our analysis suggests a series of ominous bull traps in PFE stock. Notably, the double top bull trap in December 2021 is noteworthy. A deeper retracement could follow. Therefore, we revise our rating on PFE stock from Buy to Hold. We urge investors to wait for a steeper sell-off before adding it."

This is a mis-valuation that will not last. Pfizer generated 2.9x more revenue than Lilly in FY21 - $81.3bn to $28.3bn - and will generate >3x more in 2022 based on forecasts. Pfizer also scores significantly better than Lilly in terms of price to sales and price to earnings ratios, dividend yield, and a host of other measures. Lilly's pipeline - led by Diabetes / Obesity drug Tirzepatide and Alzheimer's candidate Donanemab is promising, but over-hyped. Pfizer generated >$32bn cash from operations in FY21 and will do so again in FY22. Pfizer is the strong buy opportunity whilst Lilly is fast becoming a sell."

4529640,2022-08-04,Is Pfizer Stock A Buy After Strong Earnings? Massive Profits Won't Last,"Pfizer will have an outstanding 2022. 2023 will be a strong year as well. But there's not a lot of long-term growth to be expected - instead, revenue at the end of the current decade will most likely be meaningfully lower compared to 2022. Shares aren't expensive, but they aren't ultra-cheap, either. I do not think that Pfizer is the best buy in the biopharma space today."
4529575,2022-08-04,Pfizer: Don't Buy Now As Growth Could Slow Significantly,"Pfizer delivered another quarter of solid results, driven by its COVID franchise. We believe the market had anticipated a robust performance as it recovered remarkably from its June lows, pre-earnings. However, we believe the near-term upside in PFE has been reflected. We also believe that the market has de-rated PFE, given potentially slower revenue and profitability growth from FY23. Investors are urged to consider whether Pfizer can sustain its COVID-driven results from 2023, even as the potential for Paxlovid outside of the US seem exciting. Our valuation model indicates that investors could underperform the market by adding at the current levels. Therefore, we reiterate our Hold rating for PFE stock. We urge investors to be patient and wait for a deeper pullback first."
4530520,2022-08-05,Pfizer Looks Oversold,"Concerns about future earnings, as the COVID windfall wanes, have driven down PFE shares. PFE's valuation reflects substantial discounting of earnings potential. The Wall Street consensus outlook is bullish and suggests the shares are oversold. The market-implied outlook (calculated from options prices) is neutral to slightly bullish."
4531480,2022-08-08,What Pfizer Is Getting Through The Acquisition Of Global Blood Therapeutics,"Pfizer will acquire Global Blood Therapeutics for $5.4 billion in cash or $68.50 per share. Pfizer is getting Oxbryta, a product with close to $300 million in annualized net sales and a decent pipeline focused on sickle cell disease. GBT601 has the potential to have improved efficacy compared to Oxbryta and inclacumab could offer better efficacy and convenience than Novartis' Adakveo. Pfizer is getting good value based on the peak sales and 5-year forward revenue multiples."
4533008,2022-08-11,Pfizer Is A Solid High-Yielding Idea,"Pfizer is a high-quality, high-yielding pharmaceutical company backed up by a robust drug portfolio. We appreciate Pfizer's decision to spinoff its Upjohn generics business, which was completed back in 2020, as the deal raised billions for Pfizer and ample synergies are expected going forward. Pfizer is a tremendous free cash flow generator, with room for growth in the realm of oncology, sickle cell disease, and in emerging markets. During its second quarter earnings update, Pfizer raised its full-year guidance for 2022. Future years may face revenue and earnings pressure, however. Pfizer boasts a yield of ~3.2% backed by a strong Dividend Cushion ratio. Shares look about fairly valued at the moment, however."
4535160,2022-08-17,Pfizer: Deal For Global Blood Therapeutics Carries Risk - More M&A Is Needed,"Pfizer has become extremely cash-rich thanks to its development of COVID vaccine Comirnaty and antiviral Paxlovid. The market knows that these drug sales will likely fall dramatically, which explains PFE's poor share price performance in 2022. Pfizer has been doing M&A deals to try to find $25bn p.a. in additional revenues by 2030. The latest, for Global Blood Therapeutics and its potentially curative Sickle Cell Disease therapy, is a calculated gamble. Management ought to keep looking for deals to help bolster a portfolio that is light on blockbuster assets. M&A today will lead to better performance tomorrow."

AbbVie's net income was $924 million in Q2 2022, up 20.6% year-on-year. It is unlikely that the Inflation Reduction Act will have a strong impact on the financial position of Pfizer and AbbVie. Both companies have high dividend yields that will be of interest to long-term investors. Pfizer's total debt is $32.7 billion lower than AbbVie's."

As of 19 September 2022, Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine doses administered globally decreased from 858000 per day in the second quarter to 566000 per day in the third quarter.

Myovant currently appears to be overvalued because of uncertainties around its financial condition."
4542038,2022-09-20,Pfizer: Covid-19 Treatment Isn't Only Expansion Opportunity On Deck,"Pfizer has expected 2022 sales of COMIRNATY remains at $32 billion and then $22 billion for PAXLOVID. A possible surge in Covid-19 cases in Fall of 2022 would mean improved sales of COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID, especially if the U.S. Government takes option to buy another 195 million vaccine doses. Pfizer and partner BioNTech are advancing additional targets with mRNA vaccines, such as influenza and shingles. An expanded Acuitas LNP licensing deal gives Pfizer potential to advance another 10 targets for vaccine or therapeutics development."
4545843,2022-10-11,Pfizer: Bear Market Conviction Pick,"Rare for the current market, Pfizer rates as bullish in all five areas of my proprietary investment checklist, making the stock a bear market conviction pick. Despite substantial near-term growth and cash windfalls from its COVID-19 vaccine and treatments, Pfizer's drug pipeline is still improving with several successful recent drug launches. Pfizer rewards shareholders with yields more than double the 10-year government bond benchmark, an argument for owning the stock instead of the bond. Fundamentals are solid, valuation multiples attractive, and downside risks are low. In this bear market, finding quality enterprises trading at value prices is more the needle than the haystack. Quantitatively and qualitatively, Pfizer presents as a core holding conviction buy."
4546693,2022-10-14,The Importance Of Government Contracting For Pfizer And Moderna,"COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty and Paxlovid pill should contribute circa 55% to Pfizer's 2022 revenues. Pfizer’s revenues from the U.S. government represented 26% of total revenues for Q2 2022, up from 13% reported in 2021. Pfizer's capital structure is relatively conservative, with net debt of just $10bn. Moderna's only commercial product is its COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax with 100% government revenue share. Pfizer's sales should show less erosion in the coming years thanks to its diversified vaccine/treatment mix, as opposed to Moderna's vaccine only exposure."

PFE had another blockbuster quarter, generating $22.6bn revenues and net income of $8.6bn. Based on FY22 guidance, forward P/E is a very low ~7x, but the market knows that COVID revenues will shrink - likely by more than half - in 2023. On top of these losses, there are $17bn anticipated losses as a result of patent expirations. Management believes it can generate an additional $45bn in revenues before the end of the decade, having splashed COVID cash on new acquisitions and R&D.

However, we believe the market has de-rated PFE, as it anticipated a significant moderation in its COVID revenue moving ahead. We discuss why we expect PFE's October lows to hold, with a material re-rating likely as Wall Street's earnings projections have likely gotten highly pessimistic. Despite that, we urge investors considering adding exposure to be patient as a pullback seems imminent. Maintain Hold for now, but an entry point is looking increasingly closer."

The number of Pfizer product candidates continues to grow at a significant pace due to the continued high sales of Paxlovid. Sales of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine have plummeted in recent quarters due to declining public interest in getting vaccinated. The company's total debt was $36,999 million in Q3 2022, down about $3.5 billion from the previous quarter. A worsening COVID-19 situation in China and a significant decrease in the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies against new variants of the virus will bring Pfizer billions of dollars in profits in the coming quarters."

But, COVID policies are dialing back and the future demand for COVID products is not clear. The Street expects Pfizer’s revenues to revert in the coming years as COVID vaccination rates slow and government contracts run out. The company expects 2023 to be a transition year. Recent COVID headlines have drawn attention to the impending downturn in COVID revenue and have already had a negative impact on the share price. I believe the market is going to get hung up on the atrophy of COVID-related revenue and will overlook Pfizer’s long-term outlook. It is time to adjust my strategy for managing my PFE position as we navigate the COVID washout."
4571305,2023-01-20,Pfizer And L3Harris: 2 Recession-Resistant Companies Worth Considering,"After the S&P rebounded nicely from its September/October low, it seems that solid value opportunities are no longer available - a closer look shows that this is not the case. With a recession looming, I think it is prudent to have at least part of the portfolio allocated in recession-resistant sectors, such as defense and healthcare. In this article, I will discuss L3Harris and Pfizer - two quite recession-resistant businesses that currently trade at compelling valuations and have solid long-term prospects. Both companies face challenges, risks and uncertainties, but I believe these are very manageable and appropriately reflected in the share prices. I own Pfizer in a diversified pharma portfolio and expect to open a position in L3Harris soon to complement my other defense holdings - Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies."

What brokerage analysts are failing to appreciate is Pfizer now has the strongest balance sheet and free cash flow setup in Big Pharma. If you like cash holdings, cash generation, and a bright free cash flow future during a recession, Pfizer is now a Strong Buy."
4574822,2023-02-03,Pfizer: The Covid Reset Makes Sense,"Since the Cominarty vaccine is now arguably relegated to something similar to the seasonal flu shot with an expensive $130 retail price tag, it is unsurprising Mr. Market is bearish on the PFE stock. The generic Paxlovid may also temper some of its top-line, as witnessed with AbbVie's Humira, which experienced a -25.9% impact in the international market. However, the COVID-19 windfall has also contributed to its robust balance sheet and aggressive M&A activities, bolstering its pipelines ahead. Therefore, assuming an upward rerating, PFE could hit our price target of $55.79, suggesting a 27.40% upside potential from current levels."

4584771,2023-03-06,What To Expect From Pfizer In The Post-COVID-19 Era,"In Q4 2022, the company's revenue was $24.29 billion, up 1.9% from the last three months of 2021, despite a significant decrease in people's desire to vaccinate against COVID-19. According to the Wall Street Journal, Pfizer's management is in talks to acquire Seagen to expand the company's portfolio with promising cancer-fighting medicines. Paxlovid sales amounted to $1,834 million in Q4 2022, showing a significant increase compared to the previous year. Pfizer's current dividend yield of 4.04% is not only significantly higher than the largest pharmaceutical companies but outperforms other sector leaders such as Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola. This article will present the factors that make the company an attractive asset for dividend investors and the risks that anyone considering Pfizer as a long-term investment should be aware of."
4587120,2023-03-13,What Pfizer Is Getting From The Seagen Acquisition,Pfizer will acquire Seagen for $43 billion or $229 per share. The deal will significantly expand Pfizer's oncology presence and the company expects to generate more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted revenues by 2030. The deal also brings Pfizer a lot closer to its goal of adding $25 billion in annual revenues through business development. The price is somewhat higher than I expected.
4587037,2023-03-13,Pfizer Buys Seagen - Why This Deal May Not Please Shareholders,"Pfizer Inc. has agreed to acquire Seagen Inc. in a deal worth ~$43bn. Pfizer is issuing ~$31bn in long-term debt to finance the deal and paying the remainder in cash. Seagen is an antibody drug conjugate (""""ADC"""") pioneer with 4 approved drugs that earned revenues >$2bn in FY22. Guidance for 2023 is $2.3bn. Pfizer has had cash to burn after the resounding success of its Comirnaty COVID vaccine and COVID antiviral Paxlovid. The company has been on an M&A spree. This is not necessarily a deal to get shareholders excited, however. Pfizer has promised Seagen could add $10bn to its top line by 2030. There are obvious risks, however, that may outweigh benefits."

4593029,2023-04-09,Pfizer: Trying To Acquire Growth,"Pfizer has used the vaccine boom and related profits from the pandemic to pursue a flurry of deals. These transactions have not pleased investors, with shares trading flat since the outset of the pandemic. That marks a dramatic underperformance, as deals have to prove themselves, while the Seagen deal looks quite a bit demanding. Despite these observations, it is a non-demanding multiple which looks quite compelling."
4594521,2023-04-17,Pfizer Vs. AstraZeneca: Which Is Better For Long-Term Investors?,"In this article, we will present a comparative analysis of these two companies, one of which is becoming more and more attractive to long-term investors. However, excluding COVID-19 products from the calculations, AstraZeneca's revenue was $10,388 million in Q4 2022, up only $243 million from Q4 2021. In our estimation, Calquence and Enhertu are AstraZeneca's gems in the multi-billion-dollar oncology drugs market. Moreover, we are increasing the minimum price range noted in the previous article, """"What To Expect From Pfizer In The Post-COVID-19 Era,"""" to $37 per share, at which we will start buying shares in the company. Pfizer's dividend yield is 3.98%, well above AstraZeneca's dividend yield of 2.01%."
4598995,2023-05-02,Pfizer Q1 Earnings: COVID Franchise Outperforms While Investors Play Long Game,"Pfizer reported its Q1 2023 earnings today. The company beat expectations of revenues and EPS as its COVID Franchise outperformed. Inevitably, COVID revenues will shrink over time but management has been spending big on M&A. Management is promising some $45bn in new revenues by the end of the decade - but the market seems to want another COVID franchise. That won't happen, but for those prepared to be patient, today's earnings and the company's growth potential encourage a mild """"BUY"""" opportunity."
4605576,2023-05-17,Pfizer: A Lackluster Valuation And Soft Growth Outlook Despite Strong Free Cash Flow,"Pfizer has been among the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks this year as investors shun the free-cash-flow factor.

Investors are increasingly worried about Pfizer's ability to navigate life after COVID while facing the loss of exclusivity in the next few years. PFE's valuation has reached highly attractive levels, despite the pessimism. Pfizer is a big pharma behemoth and has proved its ability to build its COVID vaccines franchise. Long-term investors are given another fantastic opportunity to buy the steep pullback, with the risk/reward tilted heavily toward the upside."
4605670,2023-05-18,Pfizer: Getting Enticing,"Pfizer Inc. has seen its stock get shattered after enjoying COVID tailwinds. How much is too much is a personal question at the end of the day.

4607772,2023-05-27,Pfizer: Undervaluation In The Post-COVID-19 Era,"Pfizer's revenue for the first three months of 2023 was $18.28 billion, down 24.7% from the previous quarter and 28.8% from the first quarter of 2022. At the end of March 2023, Pfizer's total debt was about $36.17 billion, down substantially from 2021 despite several acquisitions. In the first quarter of 2023, Oxbryta sales reached $71 million, reflecting a 28.6% increase from the previous year. Despite the expected beginning of a period of turbulence in the stock market in the coming months, we continue our analytical coverage of Pfizer with an """"outperform"""" rating for the next 12 months. Pfizer's gross margin stood at 73.5% in Q1 2023, reaching its highest since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to recent price increases for some of the company's blockbusters, lower raw material costs, and improved drug supply chains."
4607915,2023-05-29,Pfizer: Not Quite Dead Money Walking,"PFE's historical stock performance remains mediocre compared to its pharmaceutical peers, even after adjusting for dividends. Combined with its decelerating COVID-19 portfolio and $22B worth of annualized patent cliff from 2025 onwards, we are not surprised by the pessimism embedded in the stock. Perhaps this is why PFE has aggressively pursued multiple acquisitions, with the latest incurring $31B of debt and likely $1.5B of annual interest expenses, if not more. Combined with the uncertain macroeconomic outlook, anyone looking to add here must be highly convinced of the eventual success of its multiple pipelines."
4608060,2023-05-30,Pfizer: The New Oral Weight Loss Therapy Could Be A Game Changer,"Pfizer has declined over 36% in the past two years, as investors worry about the company's growth post-COVID. The company's new oral weight loss therapy recently showed positive phase 2 data and could be a game changer as it targets the massive diabetes and obesity market. The current valuation is discounted on a historical basis and should present meaningful upside potential if the new therapy continues to make encouraging progress."

He has so many valuable insights into dividend stocks that can benefit us. It’s just his success with 10-baggers has dominated the spotlights. This article employs Lynch's approach to evaluate Pfizer and Gilead Sciences. My results show why Pfizer is the better dividend stock undercurrent conditions. The article will also demonstrate the simplicity of Lynch's method and the powerful insights they offer."
4611292,2023-06-13,Pfizer: Deeper Value Found Amidst Diversified Pipelines,"Pfizer presents a buying opportunity as value has deepened following weak price action due to post-pandemic revenue concerns. Aggressive yet speculative acquisitions demonstrate a commitment to pipeline diversification in an effort to grow into new and unique areas. Executives have suggested attention will turn to share buybacks and dividend growth as acquisitions slow down and capital returns flow in. A sustainable dividend, moderate undervaluation and high operational efficiency render a great position to build back up from."
4614199,2023-06-28,Pfizer: Come For The Dividend - Stay For The Dividend,"Pfizer's share price is going nowhere - the float is too big. Even after COVID allowed the company to generate >$100bn in revenues, it is back on the slide again. The company has spent ~$70bn on M&A and promised $25bn of new product revenues - but other key drugs are losing patent protection. Pfizer's dividend has been hiked to $0.41 and the yield is now >4%. The company is coming off the back of 4 FDA approvals in 5 weeks - but no matter how positive the news flow, the share price isn't budging. While other Pharmas' valuations skyrocket on breakthroughs in e.g. weight loss, Pfizer's sliding share price increase the dividend yield. With downside protection in place, PFE stock makes for a quite reasonable investment."

Investors have also been rotating towards companies with significant exposure to weight-loss drugs, such as Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which have outperformed their sector peers. Given relatively pessimistic analysts' estimates, the market is likely positioned for a disappointing Q2 release for Pfizer. I assessed that PFE could be at a critical long-term inflection point, suggesting that dip-buying sentiments could improve further, attracting more value investors. Investors keen to invest in a leading wide-moat biopharma company should find the current levels highly attractive."

Pfizer's revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $12.73 billion, down 30.4% from the previous quarter and 54.1% from the second quarter of 2022. However, we believe that sales of Pfizer's COVID-19 products bottomed out in Q2 and could now turn higher due to the rapid spread of a new variant of COVID-19 called EG.5.1. Nurtec ODT/Vydura sales were $247 million in Q2 2023, up 47.9% QoQ. We continue our analytics coverage of Pfizer with an """"outperform"""" rating for the next 12 months."
4628061,2023-08-14,Pfizer: Doubling Down Buying Opportunity Is Here,"Pfizer investors received disappointing guidance from management at its Q2 earnings call, as the company couldn't commit to a firm outlook for its COVID franchise revenue next year. Despite that, there was no significant selloff, suggesting that negative sentiments have already been priced in. With Pfizer's post-COVID headwinds likely bottoming out, PFE is attractively priced as the market looks past its near-term challenges. I make the case why PFE is near or already at peak pessimism, as the selling pressure has abated. Investors should capitalize aggressively while the market is ignorant.

Discontinuation of the development of lotiglipron and the Q2 revenue miss were the two recent disappointments, but the stock has stopped declining, which is a good sign. Recently acquired products like Nurtec and Oxbryta have not done well either while Vyndamax/Vindaqel continues to perform really well. Stabilization of the COVID-19 business and multiple expected product launches should improve the growth outlook in 2024 and beyond.

Multiple companies are now fighting for a share of the revenues earned by the vaccine giants, but none are seeking to stop vaccine production. Moderna is also suing Pfizer and BioNTech alleging patent infringement. The implications of these cases could be seismic for any one of these companies, particularly as we enter the era of the private COVID vaccine market."
4632170,2023-09-02,Pfizer: The Floor To This Decline Remains To Be Seen,"The decelerating COVID-19 portfolio and underperforming bolt-on acquisitions have directly contributed to PFE's lowered FY2023 guidance range. In an attempt to boost its pipeline, thanks to the patent cliff from 2025 onwards, the company has also embarked on aggressive R&D efforts, comprising 20.5% of its overall revenues. With its COVID windfall depleted and long-term debts growing to $61.67B, PFE also faces inflated annualized interest expenses of $2.03B. Thanks to the massive dividend obligations worth $9.24B annually, we do not expect any share repurchases over the next few quarters as well. PFE shareholders may want to brace for impact, due to the potential new normal in its profit margins, possibly further impacting its stock valuations/ prices in the intermediate term."
4633646,2023-09-07,Pfizer: Still Attractive Despite Recent Acquisitions,"Pfizer has made several acquisitions to expand its future drugs pipeline, including Biohaven and ReViral, with combined peak sales estimated at $6 billion. The acquisition of Seagen for $43 billion will significantly bolster Pfizer's oncology segment, which generated $2.9 billion in revenue in 1Q 2023. Despite a decline in revenue from COVID-19 vaccines, PFE's sales of Paxlovid surged to $18.9 billion in 2022."
4634064,2023-09-09,Pfizer Vs. Gilead Sciences: COVID-19 Battle Of Pharma Titans,"Wall Street underestimates the prospects of Pfizer and Gilead Sciences, given their significant role in developing vaccines and medicines against COVID-19. Gilead Sciences' revenue has remained stable in recent quarters, unlike Pfizer, whose demand for COVID-19 products fell sharply in the first half of 2023. Comirnaty sales were $1,488 million in Q2 2023, down 51.4% from the previous quarter, due to declining public interest in vaccinations and a sharp drop in COVID-19 hospitalizations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of August 19, EG.5 accounts for 21.5% of COVID-19 cases, up 2.9% from a week earlier. Unlike Pfizer, Gilead's portfolio of medicines is mainly focused on HIV treatment. As a result, this creates certain risks since its financial position depends on Biktarvy and Genvoya, whose combined sales account for 53.3% of Gilead's total revenue."
4637110,2023-09-25,Pfizer: Protracted Selloff Makes This Best Time To Buy For A Decade,"Pfizer's revenues were declining prior to the pandemic, but the success of its COVID vaccine and antiviral brought in unexpected additional revenues of >$55bn over 2 years. The company has been on a major M&A spending spree, investing approximately $27bn in under 2 years, with a potential total spending of $70bn. Pfizer aims to drive $45bn in new product revenue by 2030 through its in-house pipeline and business development, with a projected CAGR of 6%. Pfizer stock is down 35% this year alone - I have been long-term bearish on the company, but I believe shares are now undervalued. There is a near 5% dividend yield and management has set itself the target of driving >$80bn in revenues by 2030 - if it comes close to achieving that, Pfizer stock must finally realise some deserved upside."

The company will return 7.9 million oral antiviral Paxlovid treatment courses and record a $5.5 billion non-cash charge for inventory write-offs from Comirnaty. Pfizer plans a cost reduction program to deliver $3.5 billion in annual savings, but this program will take years to fully reduce costs.

4640851,2023-10-15,Pfizer: Buy This Big Pharma Stock For Safe Income And Deep Value,"Combining sustainable income and deep value is an investing strategy that can work very well over the long run. Pfizer's market-smashing dividend is comfortably covered by its adjusted diluted EPS. The pharmaceutical has the product portfolio and pipeline needed to stage a recovery in its business. Pfizer's rock-solid balance sheet earns it an A+ credit rating from S&P. The stock is heavily discounted relative to its fair value, which gives it an attractive total return profile for its overall risk."
4640939,2023-10-16,Pfizer's Sequel: Return Of The Value Stock,"Pfizer is focusing on its core growth engines and strategic acquisitions, particularly in the oncology segment, to compensate for downgraded revenue projections and a concerning debt profile. The company's financial health is fragile, with a significant decrease in FY23 revenue and EPS outlook and a high total debt-to-liquid assets ratio. Market sentiment towards Pfizer is cautious, with modest growth expectations and underperformance compared to the broader market, but limited investor pessimism and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders through dividends. Investment Recommendation: Given Pfizer's financial risk and market positioning, a """"Hold"""" stance is prudent; consider hedging strategies for risk mitigation."
4641233,2023-10-17,Pfizer: Washed-Out And On The Verge Of A Huge Turnaround,"Pfizer slashed its FY23 adjusted EPS outlook by nearly 54% due to one-time charges and a sharp reduction in revenue outlook. The company no longer expects a midpoint revenue outlook of $68.5B, downgrading it to between $58B and $61B. Despite the guidance change, Pfizer remains optimistic about the long-term opportunities for its COVID franchise. I assessed that the clarity provided by management is finally in sync with what the market has anticipated, given the hammering in 2023. Pfizer was too optimistic at the start of 2023. With PFE already in washed-out status, I argue why the updated guidance should help PFE bottom out finally, as it didn't collapse below its September lows."

We wouldn't be surprised if Pfizer goes above that. Pfizer now pays a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share which is more than 5% in annual yield."
4643238,2023-10-25,Pfizer: Ignore The Noise And Buy This Deep Value,"Pfizer's stock has underperformed the market due to declining revenue and profits on a YoY basis, but it is essential to understand that last year was an anomaly. The company's recent earnings showed a decline in revenue but compared to pre-vaccination levels, revenue has increased by 8% and profitability metrics remain strong. The stock is undervalued and has a target price of $40 according to a dividend discount model, making it an attractive investment opportunity."

The Nasdaq is up 45% YTD, while Pfizer Inc. stock is down 40%. Pfizer's yield is at 14-year highs, nearly 30% undervalued. The collapse in earnings this year is pure pandemic vaccine boom fading. Pfizer's long-term growth prospects are slightly better than the industry average, though it is growing 6X slower than Eli Lilly, which is powered by obesity drugs. In the medium term, patent cliffs on key drugs mean Pfizer is being left for dead in favor of its obesity drug-powered rivals. If you're comfortable with its risk profile, Pfizer offers Warren Buffett-like 22% annual returns over the next 2 years. For those who don't like Pharma or want superior yield, growth, and over 300% better long-term return potential than Pfizer, these five 9%-yielding blue-chip bargains are a fantastic opportunity to lock in as much as 150% returns in just the next two years, 7.5X more than the S&P 500."

Pfizer may need to look elsewhere for clinical candidates to compete in type 2 diabetes and obesity. The disappointment comes on top of the discontinuation of lotiglipron earlier this year and the mid-October revenue guidance cut driven by weaker-than-expected COVID franchise. There is little Pfizer can do about the COVID franchise shortfall and there is not really an obesity revenue bump in Street estimates."
4655948,2023-12-05,Johnson & Johnson Vs. Pfizer: Better Pharma Stock?,"Johnson & Johnson demonstrates better R&D efficiency and has a larger patent portfolio compared to Pfizer. JNJ's product pipeline in the Pharmaceutical segment has more late-stage developments, supporting its positive growth outlook. Pfizer has a stronger financial position for future M&A activities, but JNJ's acquisitions are more diversified and provide potential synergies."

In a promising sign, Pfizer has announced its 14th consecutive annual dividend increase, signaling confidence in its ability to cover payments. Pfizer stock is trading at a favorable valuation compared to its peers and has potential for upside, with a median price target of $32."
4658187,2023-12-16,Pfizer: The Bears Have Won This Round,"PFE has squandered the COVID-19 windfall by overpaying for Seagen, while contributing to the deterioration of its balance sheet and the eventual plunge in its stock prices. We believe that its inventory write-downs and goodwill amortization may accelerate in the near-term, thanks to the impacted COVID demand and expensive acquisitions, respectively. The combination of underwhelming FY2024 guidance and patent cliff/ Medicare headwinds from 2026 onwards do not bode well to PFE's intermediate term prospects as well. While we believe that the stock's bottom will eventually materialize, with it appearing to be well supported at $25s, we prefer to cautiously rate the stock as a Hold here. Observing PFE stock's trajectory may be a better strategy, before adding once the stock has reached a sustainable bottom."
4658260,2023-12-17,"Pfizer: Lost All Of Its Covid Glory, But Don't Give Up Now","Pfizer's COVID franchise outlook faced another disappointing downgrade, leading to a ten-year low in PFE. The market is right. Wall Street analysts are increasingly concerned about downgrades to Pfizer's COVID-related revenue, as they failed to anticipate its COVID outlook accurately. Pfizer assured investors there's still enough juice left in its COVID franchise, but the market likely de-risked its COVID outlook significantly to account for heightened risks. I argue why PFE is at a pivotal support level underpinning its long-term uptrend. As a result, robust buying support is still expected, given Pfizer's robust earnings capability. With PFE remaining committed to maintaining its dividend and posting solid profitability, the risk/reward looks increasingly enticing at the current levels."

Pfizer is strategically positioning itself for long-term success by expanding its oncology capabilities and focusing on cost savings and acquisitions.

Oncology has been a lagging business for Pfizer despite being a hot growth area (1.5% 3-yr CAGR for Oncology vs 4.5% 3-yr CAGR for non-COVID related revenues). Seagen may boost Oncology sales but the price paid is hefty (22.7x EV/Revenue, implied ~15x PE; 44% premium to sectoral 1-yr fwd PEs). Management's execution record has been patchy; multiple guidance cuts and margin misses in FY23 due to overestimations of COVID-related sales.

But management's conservative 2024 guidance for COVID product revenues sufficiently de-risks for related headwinds in our opinion. With the """"clearing event"""" now largely behind it, Pfizer is well positioned for accretive growth and margin expansion from both its internal pipeline and recently acquired forays in innovative medicine.

Pfizer's priorities are changing today, with the CEO pledging to cut back on large-scale investments to focus on profitability improvements. Speaking at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference last week, CEO Bourla acknowledged the company's underperformance in 2023 and introduced 4 priorities for the business in 2024.

Despite lower sales from its COVID-19 vaccines, Pfizer's other revenues grew 7% YoY in FY 2023. The decline in vaccine sales presents an opportunity for Pfizer to reinvest in research and development and develop new profitable products, which the market isn't appreciating. How low can it go?

This is a tough comparison to make, however - revenues were >$100bn in 2022 and the market well knew this was a temporary uplift. Pfizer's portfolio ex-COVID actually drove 8% year-on-year growth and the company secured 9 new drug approvals in 2023 - more than twice the number of its closest pharma rival. Unless I am missing something, Pfizer is a competitive, cash-rich pharma promising >$45bn in fresh revenue streams by the end of the decade.

Pfizer faces patent expirations and a drop in sales of COVID products but has strong pipeline and growth drivers."
4668139,2024-02-07,Pfizer: The 6.3% Yield Is A Appealing,"Pfizer reported better than expected Q4 earnings, with solid organic top line growth in FY 2023, despite a drop in COVID-19 product revenues. The drop-off in COVID-19 product sales has caused negative sentiment overhang for Pfizer's shares and the yield to soar above 6%. Pfizer has a strong financial outlook for FY 2024 and has potential catalysts for growth, including the integration of Seagen and cost savings initiatives. With a P/E ratio of less than 10X, income investors can add a top income play with restructuring upside to their portfolios."
4668982,2024-02-09,Pfizer Is A Great Investment Over The Next Decade; Buy,"Pfizer is a multinational “big pharma” with deep scientific and commercialization expertise. While the COVID-related product tailwind has become a headwind of late, it still does not justify this low a valuation given the company's strong pipeline. The COVID money basically gave Pfizer a “free” Seagen, who is the leader in ADC (antibody-drug conjugate) - the drug modality that every big pharma is trying to get in on. While some key drugs from Pfizer are facing a patent cliff, its diverse pipeline will compensate and then some."
4669587,2024-02-12,Pfizer Stock: It's Time To Buy The Dip,"Pfizer's depressed valuation and strong product pipeline make it the ultimate buying opportunity for income investors in the healthcare sector. Despite a decline in sales of COVID-19 drugs, Pfizer's operating sales grew by 7% in 2023, driven by new product launches and continued growth. Pfizer's projected EPS growth and anticipated rise in EBITDA margins suggest a positive trajectory for the company's stock, in my view. I calculate a growth potential of 20.8% by the end of 2024 and 50.2% by the end of 2025, based on conservative estimates. So I believe investors should consider adding PFE into their long-term portfolio today at the current dividend yield of 6.19% (FY2024 estimate)."

Pfizer investors will likely parse its upcoming Oncology conference to assess its ability to meet analysts' estimates. I argue why PFE's valuation has baked in sufficient pessimism to remain bullish at the current levels. Read on to find out why I have decided to maintain my Strong Buy rating.

Sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid, Pfizer's COVID-related drugs, fell by 70% and 93% respectively in FY2023. Despite the decline, Pfizer's focus on innovation in oncology and cost-saving measures may help offset the effects of the drop in sales.

The market has also priced in improved Free Cash Flow generation from 2025 onwards, with rich yields of 6.05%, making PFE's dividend investment thesis compelling. Combined with its inherent undervaluation, opportunistic investors may look forward to a potential capital appreciation ahead.

Besides these technical signs, I also see fundamental catalysts that could support further price rallies.

The recent Wall Street earnings estimates indicate that the Street expects PFE to bottom out in FY2024 in terms of EPS and that fundamentals will then rebound. Despite risks like patent expirations, Pfizer's undervaluation by at least 36.7% and growth opportunities make it a good long-term investment.

In addition, on April 26, the FDA approved Beqvez, a one-time gene therapy for treating adults with moderate to severe hemophilia B.

4702933,2024-07-08,Pfizer: The Inflection Point Is Here,"Pfizer's recent financial performance and Wall Street analysts' expectations around the upcoming quarterly earnings release suggest that we are currently at an inflection point. The company's current pipeline of new product developments looks promising, and two recent FDA approvals underscore its ability to deliver new products to the market. I expect more full-year EPS guidance upgrades soon, as it appears that the company is moving ahead of management's initial cost-cutting plans. My valuation suggests there is a 30% upside potential even if no real dividend growth is incorporated into the DDM model."

Despite revenue loss from COVID-19 drugs, the Company has a strong drug pipeline and scale advantage over rivals. Facing patent expirations and challenges from the US Inflation Reduction Act, PFE focuses on oncology drugs, biologics, and future revenue growth."
4703580,2024-07-11,Pfizer Opts To Move Forward With Once-Daily Danuglipron - Don't Hold Your Breath,"Pfizer Inc. announced today that it planned to continue development of its GLP-1 agonist weight loss drug danuglipron as a once-daily oral pill. The drug met efficacy endpoints in a Phase 2 study last year as a twice daily pill, but side effects caused a high level of patient withdrawals, undermining the results. The company says testing of the once-daily version reveals no evidence of liver damage - but it is a long way adrift in the GLP-1 space. Lilly and Novo Nordisk's Zepbound and Wegovy are set to dominate a market potentially worth >$150bn, but there are several other contenders of note in clinical studies. Danuglipron feels like a back-marker in a crowded field - Pfizer may be better off focusing on the >$70bn worth of M&A deals it has made and the >$45bn of new revenue it has forecast from these sources."
4706786,2024-07-25,Pfizer's Q2 Focus: Core Products And New Ventures,"Analysts predict Pfizer's Q2 2024 revenue to be around $13 billion​. The EPS estimate for Q2 2024 is $0.22, reflecting challenges from decreased COVID-19 product demand. Investors are closely watching the performance of Pfizer's core products, particularly in oncology and vaccines, excluding COVID-19 products. Significant focus is on how Pfizer manages upcoming patent expirations and the development of new drugs like Elrexfio for multiple myeloma​. PFE stock is a “hold” due to patent cliff risks and modest growth, suitable for value-oriented investors."
4707485,2024-07-28,High Yielding Pfizer Looks Bullish (Technical Analysis),"Pfizer yields 5.57% with a B- dividend safety rating, known for Eliquis and Xeljanz. Technical analysis tools show bullish trends: trading above 30-week EMA, increasing momentum, and improving relative strength. Smart money buying, volume spikes, and breakout from consolidation suggest bullish outlook for Pfizer stock."
4707615,2024-07-29,Pfizer: Keep On Riding The Recovery,Pfizer investors are enjoying their recent run as PFE stock has outperformed its peers and the market. Palpable optimism is reflected in PFE's upcoming Q2 earnings release. Investors have likely moved on from its COVID vaccine franchise into its oncology and weight-loss drugs growth prospects. PFE's attractive valuation and solid dividend yield suggest the recovery is likely far from over. I argue why pessimism on PFE didn't pay off for the bearish investors. Investors should keep riding on its recovery.

It’s time for Pfizer to make hay after the pandemic spike, when the stock jumped from $30 in 2020 to $60 in late ’21.

4708978,2024-08-01,Pfizer Stock: It May Be Just The Beginning Of A Solid Rally,"I initiated a """"Buy"""" rating on Pfizer stock in February 2024, and since then, it's aging well. I believe the recovery rally in PFE stock may be just the beginning. The cost management initiatives seem to be progressing faster and more efficiently than one would have thought a few quarters ago - the solid Q2 numbers show that. Wall Street analysts are still giving very modest EPS growth projections for the next few years, creating a ground for possible EPS beating in the next quarters. My earlier assumptions that the potential for margin expansion at Pfizer was enormous began to materialize. I calculate a growth potential of 42% by the end of 2025. I rate PFE stock as a """"Buy"""" again."
4710510,2024-08-05,Pfizer: Tracking Well Above The Industry,"Despite Wall Street's continued conservatism regarding its business prospects, Pfizer beat analysts' expectations for the second quarter of 2024. In addition to the raised full-year 2024 guidance, the company's remaining share repurchase authorization is $3.3 billion. Pfizer's oncology franchise sales reached $3.96 billion in the second quarter of 2024, up 25.6% year-on-year. So, sales of Padcev, approved for the treatment of urothelial cancer, amounted to $394 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of 144.7% year-on-year. Having said all of this, I continue to cover Pfizer with a 'Buy' rating."
4714016,2024-08-13,Pfizer: Growing Beyond Covid,Pfizer continues to transition to a strong future with reduced Covid drug sales.

The stock price dropped after the Q2 earnings release despite strong performance and an impressive full-year guidance upgrade, primarily due to a significant secular risk. My valuation analysis suggests that PFE's valuation is sound and reflects a significant secular risk described in the article."
4718257,2024-08-30,Pfizer Stock: Graham P/E Shows Large Discounts,"I view Pfizer Inc. as a leader in a defensive sector under temporary ROCE pressure. Its profit recovery and growth prospects are substantially underestimated by the prevailing market consensus. Even assuming the market's pessimistic consensus outlook, it is discounted by more than 10% from the Graham P/E."
4717700,2024-08-30,Pfizer: Look Beyond COVID-19 And The Patent Cliffs - Robust Long-Term Tailwinds,"PFE's bullish support has already been observed at the $25s, with the worst seemingly well behind us. Its core portfolio continues to generate robust growth at +14% YoY in FQ2'24 (excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid), with Seagen's therapies already at $2.92B in annualized revenues. FY2025 is likely to bring forth an improved YoY comparison as well, with PFE's 3Y cost optimization program expected to boost their gross/ operating margins to pre-pandemic levels. However, the management has seemingly leaned into debt to finance its hefty annualized dividend obligations, given the lower Free Cash Flow generation over the LTM. Therefore, while we remain optimistic about PFE's intermediate-term prospects, readers may want to temper their near-term expectations, since H2'24 may bring forth further deterioration in the balance sheet."
4719364,2024-09-05,Why Pfizer Investors Should Closely Monitor VAX-31,"Investing in biotech and pharma stocks is certainly not for everyone, as these companies are vulnerable to various external risks. I turned bullish on Pfizer last January based on several reasons, including the expectations for a resumption in buybacks and the company's strategy shift to focus on profitable growth. A couple of days ago, Vaxcyte, a clinical-stage biotech company, reported promising results in a Phase 1/2 trial for its pneumococcal vaccine, threatening Prevnar, Pfizer's blockbuster drug. In this analysis, I look at the next steps for Vaxcyte to commercialize the vaccine and assess the threat it poses to Pfizer's financial performance."

Pfizer's KP.2-adapted COVID-19 vaccine received FDA approval, positioning the company to capture significant market share in 2024-2025. Pfizer's Q2 2024 revenue reached $13.3 billion, with 14% operational growth excluding COVID-related products, showing strong core portfolio performance. Eliquis, Vyndaqel, and Xtandi continue driving revenue growth, while Nurtec posted a 44% annual operational revenue increase. Pfizer's Manufacturing Optimization Program aims to deliver $1.5 billion in savings by 2027, improving margins and operational efficiency."

4722690,2024-09-23,Pfizer: Undervalued Healthcare Leader Poised For Further Recovery,"Pfizer's transition from COVID revenue faces skepticism, as PFE underperformed its healthcare peers recently. Successful integration of Seagen is crucial for Pfizer's oncology portfolio, potentially lifting investor sentiment. Pfizer's cautious approach to weight loss drugs suggests success is far from certain, raising its execution risks to disrupt the market. Significant cost-cutting efforts targeting over $4B in savings are critical for near-term profitability and improving earnings outlook. I explain why PFE's growth-adjusted valuation bolsters its bullish thesis, as the market seems to have reflected significant pessimism."
4723713,2024-09-27,Pfizer: A 6% Yielding Value Deal,"Pfizer remains an attractive capital return play with a 10X P/E ratio, despite concerns about post-COVID revenue declines. The oncology business shows promising growth, particularly with products like Xtandi and Lobrena, supporting Pfizer's long-term potential. Pfizer's guidance for FY 2024 EPS has been raised, indicating strong earnings potential and undervaluation by the market. Pfizer's shares pay a healthy 6% yield and the dividend is growing."
4724463,2024-10-01,Lock In A Phenomenal Yield With Pfizer,"Pfizer's stock has declined by 50% over several years, yet it maintains a nearly 6% dividend yield, making it a valuable long-term investment. The company's quarterly performance includes $13.3 billion in revenue, $2.7 billion in R&D expenditures, and a $0.6 adjusted EPS, with respectable growth. Pfizer's oncology investments, including the $40 billion Seagen acquisition, show substantial YoY revenue growth and a robust pipeline of new drugs. Despite industry risks, Pfizer's strong cash flow, significant R&D spending, and ability to pay down debt make it an undervalued company with impressive shareholder returns."
4724358,2024-10-01,Pfizer: Growth From Oncology Franchise; Initiate With 'Buy',"Pfizer's acquisition of Seagen for $43 billion enhances its ADC technology, potentially expanding its oncology franchise and driving future growth. PFE's development of the oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, Danuglipron, aims to capture the growing obesity and diabetes treatment market by 2028. The Company anticipates 11.4% revenue growth, driven by oncology investments, M&A activities, and manufacturing optimization, despite challenges from declining COVID-related revenue. I rate Pfizer a 'Buy' with a one-year target price of $40 per share, backed by strategic acquisitions and strong growth prospects in oncology."
4724697,2024-10-03,Pfizer: Patent Fears Priced In,"Pfizer's stock has delivered a 5% total return since early July, outperforming the broader U.S. market, reinforcing my bullish stance. The latest quarterly earnings showed YoY revenue growth, marking the first growth since FQ4 2022. My dividend discount model suggests that Pfizer's stock is extremely undervalued. Patent expirations by 2027 pose a significant risk, but continued R&D investments and recent insider inactivity suggest cautious optimism about the stock's future."
4725494,2024-10-08,Pfizer: A 6% Yielding Ultra SWAN Bargain With Upside Potential,"Pfizer, yielding 5.6%, is an Ultra SWAN bargain with upside potential in the next year. Despite $70 billion in debt, Pfizer's A- credit rating and stable cash flow ensure long-term stability and very strong dividend safety. Pfizer's growth outlook includes a 5% long-term growth rate, with a 10% to 11% long-term return potential. While the risk profile is complex, S&P rates Pfizer an A credit rating and 81st-percentile risk management (the top 19% of global companies on managing risk). Pfizer's 1, 2, and 5 year return potential is 41%, 55%, and 96% respectively, significantly more than the S&P, and you're getting paid almost 6% in immediate yield."
4725542,2024-10-08,Pfizer: A Strong Product Pipeline Could Lead To Significant Upside,"Pfizer's stock has likely bottomed and shows strong technical and fundamental indicators, including a """"Golden Cross"""" and robust cost reduction plans. The company's promising pipeline, including weight-loss treatments and AI-driven drug discovery, offers significant long-term upside potential. The Seagen acquisition enhances Pfizer's cancer treatment portfolio, positioning it well in a high-demand sector. With a nearly 6% dividend yield and potential for share price appreciation, Pfizer is an attractive buy, especially on pullbacks."
4725817,2024-10-09,Pfizer: Investor Activism Is Not The Solution,"The story of activist fund Starboard Value taking a $1 billion position in Pfizer is grabbing headlines the last few days. However, no good new solutions are being offered, at least according to the stories and articles that have surfaced since the stake was first mentioned. Additional cost cutting, more share repurchases, or management and board changes are unlikely to make a change for the better at Pfizer. Starboard's previous biopharma activist campaigns have been unsuccessful, casting doubt on their ability to drive positive change at Pfizer. I remain bullish on Pfizer's long-term growth, based on a return to growth and potential multiple expansion, as well as improvement in the financials through cash flows and debt reduction."
4727879,2024-10-20,Pfizer: Activists Clouding A Promising Picture,
4729125,2024-10-24,A Pfight At Pfizer,"There's some rumbling going on within Pfizer's investment community, as an activist hedge fund says that the company's performance has not been good enough. Pfizer has been in an anomalous situation the last few years, to be sure, thanks to the pandemic. Then there's always the question of productivity in general. Whether you like Pfizer or not, the company did a great deal to combat the coronavirus."
4728945,2024-10-24,Pfizer Q3 Preview: Why The Stock Is A Buy Ahead Of Earnings,"Pfizer's Q3 consensus estimate is likely to be exceeded as the successful integration of Seagen assets and the deleveraging efforts should lead to stronger EPS growth in the coming quarters. In Q2, we saw that management's approach is effective as they have successfully reduced operating costs relative to sales, resulting in higher margins. PFE has raised adjusted EPS guidance for 2024, now expecting adjusted EPS of $2.45-2.65, up from $2.15-2.35, moving the middle of the range up $0.30. When focusing on key valuation multiples for the upcoming year (i.e., on a forwarding basis), Pfizer shares are trading at a 28-48% discount compared to the medians of the healthcare sector. Overall, I maintain my bullish rating on PFE stock and look forward to the company's Q3 2024 results."
4730563,2024-10-29,Pfizer's Oncology Triumphs Keep Investors Hooked Amid Market Volatility,"Despite today's fall in Pfizer's share price, it beat my and Wall Street analysts' expectations for the third quarter of 2024 by a large margin. Tafamidis franchise sales were $1.45 billion in Q3 2024, an increase of 9.4% quarter-on-quarter and 62.2% year-on-year. Meanwhile, sales of Padcev, approved for the treatment of urothelial cancer, amounted to $409 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 104.5% year-on-year. Pfizer also raised its 2024 non-GAAP EPS guidance from $2.45-$2.65 to $2.75-$2.95. As a result, I continue to cover PFE stock with a 'Strong Buy' rating."
4730541,2024-10-29,"Pfizer Delivers Knockout Q3 Earnings Results, But Investors Are Unimpressed","Pfizer's Q3 earnings smashed analysts' expectations, driven by a significant increase in COVID-related revenues, but the market remains skeptical about long-term growth. Despite strong financials and upgraded 2024 guidance, Pfizer's stock is down 2% in trading today, reflecting concerns that COVID revenue gains are temporary. Non-COVID segments showed mixed results, with underwhelming performance in Primary Care and Oncology, and limited returns from recent M&A activities. PFE stock's high dividend yield and low valuation metrics offer some investor appeal, but long-term growth prospects remain uncertain amid ongoing challenges."
4731443,2024-10-31,Pfizer: Overstated Pessimism Makes Little Sense,
4732487,2024-11-03,Pfizer Is A Good Stock To Buy After The Earnings,"PFE has beaten analyst estimate both top- and bottom line. The firm has also raised its full-year guidance. Investors have not taken the earnings news too positively, however, because significant portion of the growth has been driven by Covid-19 related products or non-recurring items. Based on a single stage dividend discount model and a set of traditional price multiples, PFE appears to be undervalued. In our view, the current price level could be an attractive one to initiate a position."
4733921,2024-11-08,Pfizer: Discounted For A Reason - But Dividend Story Remains Rich,"PFE's core portfolio and strategic acquisitions continue to deliver decent results, no matter the lumpy sales contribution from Comirnaty and Paxlovid. The company raised their FY2024 core portfolio sales guidance, with the richer adj EPS numbers signaling the management's promising progress in cost and operational optimization. Even so, PFE continues to face massive patent cliff headwinds through 2030, with $31.58B of its annualized FQ3'24 revenues at stake. Combined with the elevated debt levels, it is unsurprising the stock has been discounted as it has, with the management likely to embark on intensified M&A and R&D efforts ahead. These developments also imply that PFE is only suitable for investors with a long-term investing trajectory, no matter the rich dividend yields."
4736164,2024-11-11,AbbVie And Pfizer: Q3 Dividend Checkup Post-Earnings,"I review both AbbVie and Pfizer’s recent earnings reports via the window of dividends following Peter Lynch's wisdom. Lynch’s insights into dividend stocks are often in the shadow of his reputation as a legendary growth investor. These insights, when overlooked, are an unfortunate loss for dividend investors. The review has resulted in an upgrade of ABBV stock and a downgrade of PFE stock. The contrast in the PEGY ratio and recent changes in their buyback programs are especially noteworthy."
4736043,2024-11-11,Pfizer: Do Not Be Fooled By 6%+ Dividend Yield,"Pfizer's stock underperforms the S&P 500, facing patent expirations and competition, yet offers a 6.3% forward dividend yield. Despite a positive Q3 earnings surprise, profitability remains weaker than pre-pandemic levels, and valuation analysis shows the stock is fairly valued. Pfizer's oncology market share is modest, and its financials are weaker compared to leading competitors. High R&D spending and strong operating cash flow support potential new products and sustainable high dividend yield, but I maintain a 'Hold' recommendation."

4739448,2024-11-21,Pfizer: High Dividend And Low Price Might Still Offset The Expanding Risks,"Pfizer's stock appears undervalued with a high dividend yield of 6.8%, making it a potential long-term investment despite low growth expectations. The company reported strong Q3 results with 31.2% YoY revenue growth, driven by products like Paxlovid and Comirnaty. Despite high valuation multiples, a DCF analysis suggests Pfizer's intrinsic value is $37.56 with 3% growth, indicating potential undervaluation. The health system's potential changes could impact Pfizer, but the low stock price justifies a cautious """"Buy"""" rating."
4740601,2024-11-27,High-Quality Dividend Growth Stocks Near 52-Week Lows: Pfizer Is Fun,"A list of high-quality dividend-growth stocks trading near 52-week lows is evaluated based on historical and future fair values. Pfizer's financial health is concerning, with unsustainable dividend payout ratios and negative debt-to-equity ratios, but future projections suggest a potential recovery. Despite political risks and activist investor concerns, PFE's high initial dividend yield, solid ratings, and promising pipeline make it a potentially undervalued investment. Nike, Merck, Elevance, and Lam Research may also be attractive near-term investments to explore further."
4742386,2024-12-05,Pfizer: Too Cheap To Ignore,"Pfizer's fundamentals are improving, with solid Q3 earnings, upgraded 2024 guidance, and a strategic pivot towards the fast-growing oncology market. The stock is undervalued with a 32% upside potential based on a $33.39 intrinsic value per share, using the dividend discount model. Despite recent share price weakness, Pfizer offers a compelling forward dividend yield, supported by strong revenue growth and aggressive R&D spending. Short-term market sentiment and competition in the oncology space pose risks, but long-term prospects remain strong, with significant pipeline catalysts expected from 2025."
4743696,2024-12-11,Pfizer: Peer-Leading Dividend And Potential Substantial Shareholder Returns,
4743485,2024-12-11,Pfizer Stock: A Golden Buying Opportunity (Rating Upgrade),"I upgrade Pfizer to """"Strong Buy"""" due to its undervaluation, strong pipeline, and operational growth despite recent stock price declines. Pfizer's Q3 FY2024 earnings showed significant revenue and EPS growth, driven by COVID-19 therapies and oncology products, indicating robust strategic execution. The company's diversified portfolio, including successful vaccines and promising new drugs, positions it for long-term success and potential stock price re-rating. In the coming 2–3 years, I expect a 30-60% upward re-rating of PFE stock price to close the undervaluation that has developed over the last few months."
4744388,2024-12-15,Pfizer: Irrational Anti-Vaccine Fear,"Pfizer's stock has become appealing due to irrational vaccine fears. Market fears about RFK Jr.'s potential anti-vaccine stance are likely overblown, as neither he nor Trump have indicated plans to block vaccines. Pfizer's strong growth in oncology and specialty care, along with cost-cutting measures, suggest the stock is undervalued at below 10x EPS guidance. Investors should capitalize on the current weakness to own the stock, with a strong 6.8% dividend yield."
4744292,2024-12-16,Pfizer: Lowest Levels In A Decade Is An Opportunity With A Dividend Yield Exceeding 6.5%,"Pfizer's shares have significantly underperformed, but the current valuation and high dividend yield present a compelling value play. Despite revenue declines and potential regulatory risks, Pfizer remains a cash-generating machine with strong liquidity and a robust drug pipeline. Pfizer's operational improvements, debt reduction, and consistent dividend growth signal a turnaround, making it an attractive investment at current depressed levels. I am bullish on Pfizer, expecting its share price to rise as the market recognizes its improving fundamentals and economic tailwinds."

Management discussed 2025 guidance on a call yesterday, showing modest revenue growth expectations, with a focus on maintaining COVID-19 product revenues and a strong dividend yield of over 6%. Pfizer's future growth hinges on new drug launches, particularly in oncology, but there are risks if COVID revenues decline or pipeline approvals falter. Despite current challenges, I see potential for significant upside, and I am upgrading my rating to “Buy” as we head into 2025."
4745910,2024-12-22,Pfizer's 2025 'Boring' Outlook Had A Nice Surprise That Was Overlooked,"Pfizer's stock has underperformed, but management's focus on R&D and cost efficiencies should boost margins and free cash flow, supporting a Buy rating. Despite political headwinds, PFE's valuation at 9x 2025 EPS and a 6.5% dividend yield make it attractive for long-term investors. Management's 2025 guidance indicates flat sales but improved profitability, with gross margins expected to reach the upper 70s, enhancing shareholder value and supporting its strong dividend payouts. Regulatory risks exist, but Pfizer's deleveraging plans and strong cash flow generation should mitigate these concerns and support dividend growth."
4746113,2024-12-24,Pfizer: Time And Patience Ran Out (Rating Downgrade),"Pfizer stock has outperformed healthcare peers recently, but investors shouldn't assume that a sustained turnaround is close. Management attempted to assure investors about its operational growth in 2025 with a recent guidance update. However, Pfizer's oncology promises are several years from being actualized. Competition in weight loss drugs has also grown. PFE could continue to suffer from being cheap, but not attractive enough, as its growth profile looks unappealing. I argue why the recent hammering across healthcare stocks has likely made PFE less attractive. Therefore, it's time for PFE investors to consider moving on."
4746361,2024-12-25,Pfizer: Why I'm Staying On The Sidelines,"Pfizer's organic oncology business is starting to see growth acceleration, which is a positive sign that counters my earlier expectation that Seagen would carry Pfizer's whole oncology business. Frequent and material 'extraordinary' expenses are weighing down on margins. I expect these impacts to outweigh incremental cost-saving benefits in FY25. Pfizer trades at a 21.7% discount to peers on a 1-yr forward P/E basis, which is a point for the bullish arguments. The overall bearish trend on PFE vs S&P500 is still intact, although the buyers are resisting the decline for now. Trump's appointment of RFK Jr. as the U.S. Health Secretary poses a key risk as potential vaccine policy changes can impact current and future revenue streams."
4746965,2024-12-30,Pfizer: One Of The Next Big AI Winners,"Kirk Spano thinks Pfizer is poised to be a major AI winner, especially in cancer treatment. Potentially making it easier to manage like AIDS. Selling cash secured puts on Pfizer can generate income and offer a lower entry point, minimizing downside risk. Private equity is shifting from fossil fuels to AI and renewable energy, signaling a broader market transition. Pfizer's strong dividend and low downside risk make it a solid investment with a significant margin of safety."
4747175,2025-01-01,Pfizer's 2025 Comeback: What's Driving Growth,"Pfizer targets $4 billion in operational savings by 2024, improving margins and driving long-term profitability. PFE returned $7.1 billion via dividends in 9M-24, while reducing debt by $4.4 billion through balance sheet optimization. Investing $10.7-$11.7 billion in R&D, focusing on obesity treatments, oncology, and vaccines to address unmet needs. Projects 10%-18% EPS growth with stable gross margins in the mid-70% range, despite pricing pressures.

4747444,2025-01-03,Pfizer: A Step-By-Step Strategy Before Earnings,"Pfizer's stock has plummeted due to declining COVID-19 sales, expected patent losses, and political pressures, despite a high 6.45% dividend yield. PFE's strong economic moat is threatened by upcoming patent expirations, but its oncology segment shows promising growth potential. The financial outlook includes flat revenue growth, cost optimization, and a commitment to maintaining dividends, but EPS is expected to remain flat. A dynamic hedging strategy using options can yield remarkable returns with an expected slightly higher IV before earnings."
4748338,2025-01-08,Dividend Roundup: Why I Prefer Johnson & Johnson Over Pfizer,"The latest dividend declarations, combined with stock price movements, have pushed PFE’s yield to be almost twice as JNJ’s. But I want to caution you to look beyond yield (and P/E too) and examine other aspects, especially those often overlooked by dividend investors. JNJ offers better growth, a stronger track record, and also a safer payout. JNJ's stable inventory management and ongoing share repurchases further solidify its position as a better dividend stock than PFE."

PFE's growth recovery, historical cheap valuation, and positive investment sentiment make it a strong candidate for high-yield income portfolios. Insider buying and positive net money flow indicate confidence in the Company's stability and potential for a 20% yield through dividends and covered calls. PFE is recommended as a core income holding for 2025, with growth and dividend risks to be monitored, and protective puts considered for downside protection."
4752655,2025-01-28,Pfizer Q4 Earnings Preview: 5 Critical Business Issues To Consider,"Ahead of next Tuesday's earnings release, Pfizer seems undervalued based on current price of $26.55 & valuation of $150bn. But is it madness to expect upside? Quite possibly it is. My DCF analysis suggests stock ought to be valued ~$50, but this depends on the business becoming significantly derisked by new product launches, operational efficiencies, & debt paydown. Pfizer management say its key focus areas include improving R&D productivity, expanding margins, achieving commercial excellence, and optimizing capital allocation to enhance shareholder value in 2025. However, Pfizer faces significant headwinds from patent expiries, and drug pricing since the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, impacting key drugs like Vyndaqel, Ibrance, and Eliquis. The potential success of Pfizer's oral GLP-1 candidate, danuglipron, could be a game-changer, but current data and competition make this uncertain."
4754797,2025-02-04,"Pfizer Q4 Earnings: Solid Results, But Guidance And Patent Concerns Drive The Stock Down","Pfizer's Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, but the stock fell due to disappointing 2025 guidance and concerns over patent expirations. Despite a 6.7% revenue increase in 2024, Pfizer's 2025 guidance shows stagnation, with projected revenues between $61.0B and $64.0B, comparable to 2024. Investors are wary of Pfizer's ability to offset a potential $17-18B revenue loss from patent expirations by 2030, impacting key drugs like Eliquis and Ibrance. Pfizer's future growth hinges on successful R&D and commercialization of new drugs, particularly in oncology, amidst a challenging pharmaceutical landscape."
4756618,2025-02-10,Pfizer: Challenges Loom Amid Overvaluation,"I have downgraded Pfizer Inc. stock to Strong Sell due to stagnant revenue, substantial patent cliffs, regulatory, legal, and reputational headwinds, and overvaluation concerns. Despite a 24.7% YoY revenue growth in FQ4, Pfizer's financial flexibility remains weak with significant net debt and no new products to offset patent losses. Valuation analysis indicates PFE stock is overvalued with a fair share price below $25, and consensus estimates forecast a below 2% dividend growth rate for the next two fiscal years. While Wall Street analysts see a 21% upside potential, I emphasize multiple target price downgrades and rare trading above the average target price over the last five years."
4757302,2025-02-12,Pfizer: 3 Key Risks That Warrant A Sell,"Pfizer's business is facing material revenue shrink issues due to many patent expirations over the next 3 years. Quarterly revenue run rate analysis suggests management may be underestimating the impact. PFE continues to have recurring 'unusual charges.' Accounting for this, its EBIT margins are in barely profitable territory. The Company is trading at a 32% 1-yr fwd PE discount to peers, but I think this is deserved given its revenue and profitability challenges. Relative technicals vs. the S&P 500 look bearish, having recently made a new lower low in the ratio charts. Blockbuster drug launches are an upside risk. But I think management's optimism here may be overestimated, as they have grossly overestimated drugs' commercialization potentials before."
4758922,2025-02-17,"Pfizer: Danuglipron Could Tip The Scale In A Few Years, But For Now, Sell","I rate Pfizer a sell for the next 18–24 months. I expect continued headwinds from Medicare Part D redesign and patent expirations for Eliquis and Prevnar-13 in 2026. Medicare changes will cut $1 billion from 2025 revenue, with PFE now responsible for 20% of catastrophic drug costs. Danuglipron could be Pfizer's turnaround catalyst if late stage trials succeed in 2025. I expect its potential launch in late 2026 or early 2027 to boost investor sentiment. In the short term, the 6.6% yield, coupled with favorable price action and low valuation ratios, could attract value investors. I believe shorting now lacks an asymmetric risk-reward profile."
4759444,2025-02-19,Why Pfizer's Stock Price Isn't Reflecting Its True Value,"Pfizer's EPS and revenue beat my expectations, mainly due to strong sales of its anti-cancer medications. So, Xtandi sales amounted to $565 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 79.9% year-on-year. A key contributor to its strong performance was its Vyndaqel family, whose sales grew more than 60% year over year. In addition to reducing Pfizer's net debt by $4.65 billion over the past 12 months, you'll learn why I believe it is an attractive stock for income-oriented investors."
4759469,2025-02-19,Pfizer Stock's Upside Got Bigger,"Pfizer's stock remains a """"Buy"""" with a projected 45% upside, driven by strong EPS growth and cost reduction initiatives despite market caution on drug exclusivity losses. Recent Q4 FY2024 results showed significant earnings beats, with non-COVID sales up 12% YoY and adjusted EPS beating consensus by 37%. Pfizer's robust R&D pipeline, including multiple Phase 3 readouts and regulatory decisions, is expected to drive future growth and offset patent expirations. Despite risks, Pfizer's attractive valuation and potential for top-line expansion from R&D monetization suggest a significant revaluation opportunity in the next 1-2 years."
4760426,2025-02-21,Pfizer: Investors Won't Stick Around Forever,"Pfizer looks like """"dead"""" money, although income investors may find its dividend yield appealing. Is that enough to lift its momentum? Structural growth challenges and near-term headwinds could set Pfizer's recovery back further. Pfizer needs to race against time to justify its expensive Seagen acquisition, but the road ahead isn't that clear yet. While PFE's valuation is undoubtedly cheap, questions must still be asked whether it seems more like a value trap. I argue why investors shouldn't think that bulls will linger on this underperforming stock forever. It's time to move on."
4760934,2025-02-22,Pfizer: No More Growth - Still A Worthy Dividend Buy,"PFE's sell-off triggers a rich dividend yield of 6.73% and double digits capital appreciation prospects, thanks to management's focus to """"enhancing long-term shareholder value."""" Despite the patent cliff headwinds and IRA Medicare Part D redesign impacts, its core portfolios and strategic acquisitions demonstrate robust growth profile, particularly in oncology. These developments underscore why the management's focus on intensified business developments and R&D efforts has been well justified. PFE's debt levels appear to be on a downtrend as well, aided by the richer Free Cash Flow generation and promising consensus forward estimates. Combined with the discounted valuations and bullish support at the Q4'24/ Q1'25 bottom of $25s, the stock remains compelling here."
4761282,2025-02-24,Pfizer: What The Summit Therapeutics Deal Brings,"Pfizer and Summit Therapeutics announced a clinical trial collaboration that involves Pfizer's ADC pipeline and Summit's ivonescimab. Pfizer will conduct combination trials of its vedotin-based ADCs with ivonescimab, and both companies will oversee the trials. Both companies keep the rights to their respective products, and Pfizer's risk is limited to the cost of the clinical trials. PD-[L]1/VEGF bispecific antibodies became a hot area in oncology since the positive phase 3 data of ivonescimab in non-small cell lung cancer patients. This strategic partnership positions Pfizer to capitalize on promising oncology advancements, potentially adding billions to its top and bottom line."
4764358,2025-03-04,Pfizer Remains A Good Pick For Dividend Investors,"Pfizer's Q4/24 results showed significant improvements, with total revenue up 21.9% YoY and adjusted diluted EPS increasing 530% to $0.63. Despite modest 2025 guidance, Pfizer's oncology and anti-obesity drugs present growth potential, countering analysts' low expectations. However, risks remain, which include political challenges and patent expirations. With a high dividend yield and undervaluation based on intrinsic value calculations, Pfizer remains a solid investment for stability in turbulent times."
4764806,2025-03-05,Pfizer: It's Time To Play Defensive,
4765672,2025-03-07,Pfizer Vs. Johnson & Johnson: Who's The Better Bargain For Investors,"Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer occupy leading positions in the healthcare sector. Each of them has advantages, as well as dark spots in the portfolio of drugs relative to the comparator. In this article you will find out who is more promising for long-term investors."
4766286,2025-03-11,Pfizer: Undervalued Safe Haven In Risk-Off Market​,"Pfizer remained flat while the S&P 500 dropped 2.25%, reinforcing its defensive strength in a risk-off market. CY24 revenue reached $63.6B (+6.7% YoY), with non-COVID sales growing 12%, exceeding expectations of 9%-11%. R&D pipeline advanced with 12 approvals, 7 pivotal study starts, and 8 Phase 3 readouts, boosting oncology and obesity treatments. P/E of 8.59 trades 52% below the sector median, while a P/S of 3.12 is 19% under its 5-year average. Cost efficiencies, market share gains, and stable revenue make Pfizer a strong long-term investment in volatile markets."
4769667,2025-03-22,Pfizer: Bulls Need To Check Out Its Graham P/E,"Bulls have good reasons to love PFE, with attractive dividend yield and low P/E ratio being two of the frequently mentioned ones. But I urge potential investors to consider the contradicting factors against the bullish sentiments. With its bleak growth outlook, the Graham P/E ratio suggests a valuation premium instead of a discount. PFE's elevated debt levels also suggest that simple accounting P/E ratios understate its current valuation risks."
4770324,2025-03-25,Pfizer Is Trading As If It's 2009 Again,"Pfizer's stock is poised for growth due to its strong pipeline, smart cost management, and recovery from COVID-19 revenue decline. Recent acquisitions and product launches in oncology and vaccines strengthen Pfizer's market position and future revenue streams. Despite potential risks like tariffs and drug development delays, Pfizer's current valuation is attractive, resembling 2008-2009 levels. I maintain a """"Strong Buy"""" rating, believing the stock is undervalued and positioned for continued recovery and growth."
4771283,2025-03-28,Pfizer: Shares Stabilize At $25 As Institutions Begin To Load Up (Rating Upgrade),
4771771,2025-03-31,"Pfizer: Looks Better Than Most, But I Can't Eat Relative Returns","Pfizer is operationally lagging behind other large companies, impacting its financial performance. Despite being cheaper than peers, there are valid reasons for Pfizer's current stock price level. Pfizer isn't a bad company, but it faces significant operational challenges. Investment in Pfizer should consider its relative valuation and underlying reasons for its stock price."
4773989,2025-04-09,Pfizer: Anticipating A Game-Changer Soon,"I reaffirm my Buy rating on Pfizer due to expected promising updates on danuglipron and strong capital efficiency metrics, despite the recent stock pullback. Pfizer's management is expected to announce danuglipron updates soon, potentially boosting investor sentiment and stock performance. Pfizer's cost reduction programs and revenue growth targets for CY25 remain on track, with EPS projected to more than double. Current valuations make Pfizer look extremely undervalued at just 8x earnings, especially with a ~7.5% dividend yield, presenting a compelling investment opportunity."
4773882,2025-04-09,Pfizer: Best-In-Class Dividend Yield Together With Dirt Cheap Valuation,"Pfizer's 7.5% dividend yield is safe due to revenue growth, cost efficiency, and a stronger balance sheet, making it a strong buy. Pfizer's innovation in R&D, including AI partnerships and new drug approvals, promises long-term market cap growth and a competitive edge. Defensive stocks like Pfizer are attractive amid market volatility, with the pharmaceutical sector being less vulnerable to economic cycles. Despite competition risks in oncology, Pfizer's undervaluation and high dividend yield make it a compelling addition to portfolios."
4774658,2025-04-12,Pfizer: A Strategy For A Chaotic Implied Volatility,"Pfizer faces significant revenue pressure from patent expirations and declining COVID vaccine sales, with at most flat growth prospects over the next five years. A base case Fair value estimate indicates a potential 23% upside, based on 1% dividend growth for the next five years. My dynamic hedging strategy with long Put options yielded a 2.65% ROI in a low IV environment, but current extreme IV suggests selling options for fat premiums. Selling an ATM Put option expiring Nov'25 could bring 39% ROI (65% annualized, or even higher if the option is closed early)."
4774782,2025-04-13,Pfizer: Don't Make The Same Mistake Buying This Dip Again,"Pfizer faces considerable headwinds, including regulatory scrutiny, geopolitical uncertainties, and intense competition in the obesity drug market. Despite being solidly profitable, Pfizer's topline growth is expected to remain tepid through 2027, possibly keeping growth investors away. The uncertainties spurred by the Trump administration have likely spooked more defensive investors, although income investors might find PFE's 8% forward yield appealing. Yet, the lack of near-term catalysts and compounded by a surge in structural impediments to PFE's thesis have justified the recent crash to a multi-year low. I argue why investors keen on catching this falling knife are exhorted to think thrice and not make the same mistakes as dip buyers previously."
4775668,2025-04-16,Pfizer: Tasty 7% Yield,"Pfizer Inc.'s stock is trading at $22 with an 8% dividend yield, driven by market fears over losing vaccine revenues. The biopharma has a robust pipeline with potential mega blockbuster cancer drugs and a reduced reliance on Covid-related sales. The company maintains robust cash flows, covering R&D and dividends, and recently sold $6 billion in Haleon shares, boosting liquidity. Investors should capitalize on PFE stock's weakness, as the market is overly bearish on vaccine sales risks while Pfizer diversifies its portfolio."
4775766,2025-04-17,"Pfizer: Risks Priced In, Buy The Exceptional Valuation And Yield","Pfizer has faced headwinds post-COVID, but remains a key player with a robust R&D pipeline and an attractive 7.5%+ dividend yield. The pharmaceutical industry thrives on high R&D investment and patent protections, making Pfizer's development pipeline crucial for long-term growth. Despite recent setbacks, Pfizer's strategic initiatives, including cost-cutting and acquisitions, position it for future profitability and market leadership. Current valuation metrics undervalue Pfizer's potential, presenting an exceptional buying opportunity with a compelling 7x PE ratio and a recently increased dividend."
4776477,2025-04-21,Pfizer: Is The Dividend Yield Worth The Effort?,"Despite its historical underperformance and declining dividend growth trajectory, Pfizer's 7.63% dividend yield is attractive, making it a compelling income stock candidate. CEO Bourla's strategic focus on R&D, cost-cutting, and new revenue streams from acquisitions aims to mitigate upcoming revenue losses and drive future growth. Despite current challenges, Pfizer's robust cash flow, cost-saving initiatives, and potential new blockbusters by 2030 present a speculative but promising investment opportunity."
4777272,2025-04-23,Pfizer Earnings Preview: Pharma May Plumb New Depths After Obesity Drug Debacle,"Pfizer Inc.'s stock has performed poorly despite massive COVID-19 earnings, trading at a 12-year low due to flawed M&A deals and high debt levels. The discontinuation of danuglipron, a potential obesity drug, highlights Pfizer's struggle to develop successful new drugs, impacting its market position. Pfizer faces significant challenges including patent expiries, drug pricing controls, and questionable management decisions, casting doubt on its future performance. Despite these issues, Pfizer's high dividend yield and substantial revenue generation provide some investor appeal, but I maintain a """"Hold"""" rating ahead of Q1 earnings."
4778552,2025-04-27,Pfizer: I Am Locking In A 7.5% Dividend Yield Before Earnings,"Pfizer's Q1 earnings release is a prime opportunity to secure about a 7.55% dividend yield, with revenue stabilizing post-pandemic and strong cost efficiency. Pfizer's robust product pipeline and consistent R&D investments position it well for future growth, despite past revenue volatility from COVID-19. Valuation metrics indicate Pfizer stock is significantly undervalued, with crucial ratios like Price/Book and Price/Cash Flow much lower than industry averages."
4779062,2025-04-29,"Pfizer: Patent Cliff Nears, Danuglipron Dreams Fade Away","Pfizer is deeply undervalued, and has a high dividend yield, and I see tons of institutions and analysts buying the dip. Yet, I'm considering a short position through (expensive) OTM puts. A pullback to the mid-$20s would be a good entry point. I believe Pfizer's fundamentals alone won't revive sentiment without a compelling narrative. I believe Danuglipron's discontinuation wiped out Pfizer’s best shot at riding the GLP-1 hype. Risks include losing it all, as I am dealing with options. I hope I'm clear: don't follow my bets. As you are about to find out, I see nothing that can turn around investor sentiment this year. Therefore, I project the downward momentum to continue."
4779581,2025-04-30,Pfizer's Q1 Update May Mark A Bottom In The Stock,"Pfizer is facing some revenue pressures due to some higher Medicare discounts, and this has led to a small miss on revenue delivery in Q1 FY25. Pfizer is making meaningful improvements on profitability and is on track to realize a ~12.3% margin lift from 2024 until the end of 2027 from various cost saving initiatives. Stopping R&D of an obesity drug that had $10 billion annual revenue potential is a major setback and if PFE tries M&A instead, there is a risk of overpaying again. PFE stock is trading at trough valuations and at a larger-than-usual discount vs peers. So I think there is some decent margin of safety. Technical analysis vs SPX500 suggests PFE may be forming a bottom, but strong buyer signals are still absent."
4786775,2025-05-14,Dividend Checkup Amid Trump Drug Pricing Order: I Prefer AbbVie Over Pfizer,"Ongoing tariff disputes and President Trump’s drug pricing order heighten uncertainties for AbbVie Inc. and Pfizer Inc. The more uncertain the time, the more investors should focus on return vectors that are less ambiguous. ABBV's superior dividend track record, safer payout ratio, consistent share buybacks, and robust margins make it an overall better package compared to PFE."
4786349,2025-05-14,Pfizer: Bearish Catalysts Brewing,"Pfizer's 7.45% forward dividend yield is misleading, as the share price decline outpaces the payout. Weak dividend growth, stagnant EPS projections, and a looming patent cliff are significant bearish catalysts for Pfizer. Regulatory hurdles and bearish technical indicators further reinforce the negative outlook for Pfizer's stock. Despite some bullish analyst ratings, the 6% upside potential does not justify the risks associated with Pfizer's deteriorating fundamentals."
4787683,2025-05-16,Pfizer's Turnaround Story Is Stronger Than You Think,
4788500,2025-05-20,Pfizer Thinks Bigger With 3SBio Deal,"Pfizer Inc. decided to think bigger after the Summit deal in February, and that it needs control of a PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody versus participating with its ADC pipeline. The 3SBio deal allows increased control of its oncology pipeline and much higher financial rewards in the long run, and comes at a relatively low cost. The jury is still out on the PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody class of drugs, but the data to date make this approach worth exploring, and perhaps even necessary. I expect PFE to do more deals in the following months and quarters, and obesity deals are likely next."
4788396,2025-05-20,Pfizer: Better To Face The Harsh Reality Than Continue Waiting,"Pfizer faces several headwinds, including patent cliffs, regulatory risks, and a setback in obesity drug development, dampening near-term growth prospects. Despite a diversified pipeline and strong dividend yield, topline growth is expected to remain tepid through 2028, with restructuring and cost-cutting in focus. The stock seems significantly undervalued, but persistent bearish momentum and unattractive growth metrics warrant caution rather than a bullish stance. While Pfizer's attractive dividend yield might endear to income investors, I explain why PFE might struggle for traction in the next few years."
4788890,2025-05-21,Pfizer Looks Like A Great Play At Current Valuations,"Pfizer is an attractive value play, trading at a significant discount despite strong profitability and growth fundamentals versus peers.
         The company leads its peer group in EBITDA and revenue growth, while maintaining solid margins and forward growth expectations.
         Risks include increased competition in the ATTR-CM market and ongoing technical downtrends, but cost-cutting measures may enhance efficiency.
         I rate PFE a clear buy at current levels, but recommend buying in tranches to manage potential further price declines."
