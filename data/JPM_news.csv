JPMorgan continues to invest in growth, including its national online bank, de novo organic branch expansion, and growth in services like payments and custody. Low-to-mid-single-digit long-term growth can support a fair value of $120, and I believe JPMorgan remains one of the best banks in the business."

We believe the stock withstood the bad news very well - indicative that a future quarterly positive surprise will result in a substantial price spike. At 12.5 times earnings, we believe the stock is currently undervalued by about 20%."

JPM's current 17% Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) is sustainable, given recent track record and improving competitiveness. Retail banking business (CCB) may have """"over-earned"""" in 2018 but not dramatically; mortgage production revenue & card income are still low. With Price / Tangible Book Value of 1.9x and ROTCE of 17%, returns will be near 10% a year from capital distributions and asset mix change.

Rising deposit costs and peaking credit remain background threats, while larger-scale M&A transactions could alter the competitive landscape over time. JPMorgan still looks undervalued, and while this isn't the best time in the banking cycle, the long-term opportunities look attractive."

The company also boasts a fortress balance sheet. JPMorgan has outstanding management and an excellent CEO in Jamie Dimon, who understands that responsible banking is good and safe banking. The company allocates capital wisely, focusing on organic growth and investment, then only repurchasing stock when there is excess capital that cannot be used in the business. JPMorgan's long-term focus is what encourages me as an investor to know that the company's growth is sustainable."

4275250,2019-07-16,JPMorgan: Likely To Generate 10% Annual Total Returns Over The Next Decade,"Having raised its dividend each year since 2011, JPMorgan is a Dividend Challenger and has emerged from the Financial Crisis stronger than ever. While the company faces its fair share of risks, it is the highest quality bank in the United States, with a strong balance sheet, and Jamie Dimon leading the charge. Adding to the case for an investment in JPMorgan is the fact that the company is trading roughly at fair value. Between the 3.1% dividend, 7% earnings growth, and 0.1% valuation multiple expansion, JPMorgan is likely to deliver 10.2% annual total returns over the next decade."
4275246,2019-07-16,JPMorgan Chase & Co. Continues To Set The Standard,JPMorgan Chase & Co. does not seem to be conforming to investor expectations about how commercial banks performed in the second quarter of 2019. The bank posted a 16 percent return on common equity in the second quarter following what looks like a financially conservative business model. The bank seems to be well prepared for slower economic growth and falling interest rates coming from a change in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.
4275237,2019-07-16,JPMorgan: The Threat Of A New Financial Crisis,"Andrew Lim, an analyst from SG, addressed a very important issue on Q1 2019 earnings call. CLOs are a very dangerous instrument that investors and banks alike have been abusing. Levfin market has surpassed $1 trillion and CLO spreads continue to rise, resulting in a great risk for investors and the global economy. JPM is among the most exposed banks to CLOs and will likely suffer mark-to-market losses on its balance sheet if a stressed and illiquid market environment is on its way."
4275471,2019-07-17,JPMorgan Is Undervalued,"Buying top quality stocks for attractive valuation levels can be a simple and effective strategy for superior returns. JPMorgan is arguably the strongest player in the US banking sector, with remarkable competitive strengths and a proven management team. Financial reports for the second quarter of 2019 confirm that the company is as strong as ever. The stock is attractively valued when looking at both valuation ratios and cash distributions."

         19Q2 results released yesterday show how JP Morgan is continuing to deliver on its medium-term outlook, including a 17% ROTCE.
         Steady loan growth, net asset yield and operational leverage continue to drive solid earnings and capital returns, including a 3% dividend yield.
         JP Morgan will deliver on its outlook even with U.S. rate cuts, because of in-built conservative assumptions and its strong franchise.
         At $115.12, shares trade at a premium to other large cap banks, but offer a solid 10% annual return. We re-iterate our Buy recommendation."

JPM performance remains strong and while the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, they do need to be addressed.

4275619,2019-07-18,Just 'Okay' Is Still Pretty Good For JPMorgan,"JPMorgan's second-quarter results were """"only"""" more or less as expected, with some pressure on NIM offset by higher fee income and in-line expenses. Loan growth is unremarkable, but JPMorgan's deposit quality is strong and the bank continues to pursue growth in fee-generating areas like payments and private banking. JPMorgan's shares still look undervalued despite an established track record of excellent results."
4276035,2019-07-19,JPMorgan Chase: Boring Is Good,"By JPMorgan Chase's standards, 2Q wasn't a stellar quarter, but it was good enough to keep the investment thesis intact. The company's diversification is a key attraction as we enter what might be a bumpier period for banks. The benefits were on display again in 2Q as weakness in CIB and NII margin pressure were offset by strength in other areas, notably cards. JPM leads the pack on revenue growth and ROTCE. This, plus the company's defensive characteristics, means its premium P/TNAV rating (1.8x) is still worth paying."

4296692,2019-10-15,JPMorgan Chase: A Must-Have,JPM has just reported earnings and we think it provides a good read on the financials sector. We remain bullish despite the movement in rates. Any multiple expansion is predicated on future growth of the banking sector that will stem from increased global economic activity.

With 8.1% year-on-year revenue growth, stable credit costs, operational leverage and buybacks, EPS is again up mid-teens year-on-year in Q3. The U.S. economy and credit quality continue to be healthy, and JPMorgan has a """"fortress"""" balance sheet positioned well for any downturn. We believe JPMorgan can continue to deliver on its target of an average ROTCE of 17%, which on 2x P/TBV implies a reasonable 12x P/E.

4307858,2019-11-19,JPMorgan Chase: Still The Best And Still A Buy,"Is it worth paying a 45% valuation premium to own JPMorgan? That's the question I'm confronted with whenever I revisit this stock. So far the answer has always been yes. JPM remains best-in-class across most financial metrics and it is making superior strategic choices than peers. Two big strategic bets on the strength of the US consumer and on consolidation in fixed income investment banking are paying off handsomely. As a result, peer-beating revenue growth across the Consumer & Community Banking and IB franchises is driving industry-leading net profit growth. JPM is 40% more profitable than the peer group, justifying the P/TNAV premium. With a $148 fair value target I continue to rate JPM a BUY."

I maintain my views that JPM is perhaps the best stock to own in the banking sector."

Since the interview, 10-year interest rates have gone down from 2.67% to 1.8%, a decline of 32% and JPM stock has gone up over 30%.

The return wasn't achieved in the realm of """"basic banking"""" as low interest rates and Fed policy made it difficult for any bank to earn a higher net interest margin. Given this performance, and given the bank's efforts to be a leader in financial technology, JPMorgan is as well positioned as anyone to lead the industry forward."
4316999,2020-01-15,JPMorgan Adds Another Quarter To Its Remarkable Performance Run,"JPMorgan delivered another strong quarter, and one that is likely to compare well to its peer group as the earnings season develops. Strong trading drove the quarter, but core net interest income was better than expected, and PPNR was over 6% better than expected. JPMorgan shares look more reasonably priced today, but high single-digit return potential is still good enough for what I believe is one of the best banks out there."
4317424,2020-01-16,JPMorgan Chase: Huge Pop Necessitates Reallocation,"JPM is a long-term core holding of many on our team but our followers know we often trade around the core position.

         However, I've got to agree with many other contributors on this site that the air is getting very thin at the valuation levels we've now reached.
         At a push I can see the stock getting to $150 and I'm inclined to hold on for the last c.10% upside.
         But I'm setting $150 as my hard take-profit level and I'll probably use the proceeds to build a position in cheaper P/TNAV names like Citigroup or Wells Fargo."

Near-term efficiency pause to weigh on ROTCE, though the ~17% ROTCE medium-term target looks conservative. A shrinking cost base and further share gains should drive medium-term upside. Management's more opportunistic approach to repurchases could boost the stock. At ~1.3x tangible book, JPM stock prices in much of the downsides but not enough of the upside."
4332242,2020-03-16,JPMorgan Chase: The Hidden Benefits Of Some New Partnerships,"JPMorgan Chase substantially increased benefits for cardholders with new deals with Lyft and DoorDash. Sapphire Reserve customers will save as much as 32% off Lyft rides, in particular. Chase is not just adding perks at random. Rather, it seems to be building Reserve as a platform for modern city customers embracing MaaS. Mobility as a Service is increasingly relevant to urban dwellers, but requires scale to operate profitably. Chase's ability to steer a large number of customers could allow it to extract profit from the new industry. More importantly, Chase is accruing significant data about its customers and how they use the services."

Furthermore, these banks are expected to contribute to the lending efforts being created by the Federal Reserve and the federal government to support credit extension. Major question: should JPMorgan Chase & Co. suspend its dividend payouts, much as they, along with the other largest banks in the country, have voluntarily suspended stock buybacks?"

The current consensus is for EPS to decline 35% this year on a 2% decline in revenue. On average, JPM has repurchased 5% of its shares on an annualized basis the last eight quarters. The stock sports a 4.3% annual dividend yield at its current price. Using longer-term averages, JPM grew EPS 12% from 2010 through 2019 while revenue grew 1%. Use those averages to value the stock."
4337622,2020-04-14,JPMorgan: Still A 'Best Of The Rest' Banking Stock,"JPMorgan's massive all-around miss in 1Q20 merely reflects stale analyst estimates and a challenging environment ahead. The results of the quarter were heavily influenced by markdowns and a reserve build of $6.8 billion that could rise in the next couple of quarters. While business fundamentals will be in flux for a while, I continue to believe that JPMorgan will come out of the current crisis a winner."
4337761,2020-04-15,JPMorgan: Not Chasing Yet,"JPMorgan kicked off earnings season with a huge loan-loss allowance, hurting earnings a great deal. The company is taking huge billion reserves, but is it enough? The bank is well run and the government will directly or indirectly bail out at least a few of the victims of the current crisis. Despite all of this, I find current levels a bit optimistic given the economic conditions and expectations of a swift rebound."
4337756,2020-04-15,"JPMorgan Will Be A Survivor, But Chaos Will Reign For A Little While","JPMorgan surprised the Street with significant reserve-building, and there may be more reserving needed if the U.S. economy doesn't bounce back in the second half of the year. Non-performing loan numbers are going to get ugly, but charge-offs are holding steady for now and JPMorgan has the capital to weather some meaningful charge-offs. Long term, JPMorgan continues to follow a multi-point growth strategy, including organic branch growth in attractive markets and potential M&A in asset/wealth management and fin-tech. There's still ample modeling uncertainty in the near-term, but I believe JPMorgan can grow earnings at a long-term rate of 3%, supporting a long position today."

The valuation is fair given the circumstances, but I'd be a buyer in the $70's, maybe low $80's.  Other banks more attractive on a relative basis due to valuation."
4337734,2020-04-15,JPMorgan Chase & Co. First Quarter Earnings: Getting Ready,"First quarter earnings at JPMorgan Chase & Co. were down substantially from one year ago, but the difference was also solely a result of an increased provision for loan losses. JPMorgan is getting ready for """"a fairly severe recession"""", and the changes in the bank's accounting statements and the comments of CEO Jamie Dimon show how the bank is preparing. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is still the """"class"""" of the largest banks in the United States and is providing leadership in working with the government to mitigate the coronavirus impacts."
4337976,2020-04-16,JPMorgan: 30%+ Fall Has Priced In Worst Case; Upgrade To Buy,"JPM's share price has fallen by more than 30% since we downgraded our rating to Neutral in January, as the COVID-19 lockdown continues. COVID-19's impact is not yet fully visible in 20Q1 results; there will be more reserve build and revenue declines in the rest of 2020. Even in JPM's """"extremely adverse"""" scenario, investor return would still be positive in 2 years, provided return on equity (ROTCE) recovers. Given JPM's structural advantages, the most likely outcome is a flat or slightly up Tangible Book Value, and a 16% ROTCE, in 2 years' time. At $90.90, this implies a 29% total upside and a double-digit annualized return for the next two years. We upgrade our rating to Buy."
4340314,2020-04-27,How To Get Into JPMorgan Chase,"We believe the PPP loans from the government is a strong backstop for JPM, with another round of funding recently approved, which was further bullish. Bearish points in Q1 (and definitely for ongoing Q2) include obvious pain from economic woes and preparing for loan losses. The company still has a fortress-like balance sheet and is positioned to defend itself in coming quarters. Net interest revenue and non-interest revenue were decent, but missed Q1 expectations overall. The market is offering a discount, but let the market punish it more."

4353863,2020-06-15,Bank On The Best: JPMorgan Chase,"Whether the recovery is L shaped, U shaped, or V shaped, we expect JPMorgan’s profits to rebound over the long term. Unlike the 2008 Financial Crisis, in which many banks were under capitalized relative to their risky assets, banks’ balance sheets are much stronger going into the COVID-19 pandemic. JPM is down 29% YTD and now trades at its cheapest price-to-economic book value ratio (0.6) since 2012, and nearly equal to 2009."

4358613,2020-07-15,"JPMorgan's Core Banking Business Under Pressure, But The Long-Term Outlook Is Still Positive","JPMorgan's core pre-provision operating income was well above Street expectations, with the bank getting a major boost from its trading and investment banking operations.
         Core banking performance was weaker, with a $0.05/share miss at the PPOP line driven by spread pressure, weaker loan demand, and surging deposits.
         The bulk of the provisioning is likely over, but provisions are still likely to remain elevated relative to recent quarterly trends through mid-2021.
         Low rates and economic uncertainty are a near-term headwind, but JPMorgan looks undervalued on a long-term basis."
4358598,2020-07-15,JPMorgan Is A Buy After Trough Earnings,"JPM reported strong results that proved out its diversified business model. The company's trading operations provided a cash windfall that offset weakness in its commercial banking operations. Its $8.9 billion reserve build protects against a downbeat economic outcome, suggesting the vast majority of reserves have been taken. As such, JPM is poised to earn $12/share over the next year, making its stock attractive."
4358843,2020-07-16,Buy JPMorgan On Any Dip Given Slight Undervaluation And Quality Franchise,"JPMorgan generates about $13B of pre-provision net revenue each quarter, providing an immense cushion to shield against loan losses. The bank's $34 billion of reserves should be enough to manage the crisis barring worst-case scenarios. The stock is undervalued relative to the overall market, which I view to be overvalued, but there could be more upside in banks trading at cheaper valuations."
4359111,2020-07-17,JPMorgan: Raising Estimates On Q2 Results; Reiterate Buy,"We review our JPM Buy case after Tuesday’s Q2 results, and with shares now having returned a low-teens percent since our Buy rating in April. We now believe JPM can continue to add to Tangible Book Value and pay dividends during the downturn, but push out our exit to 2023 year-end. During H1, JPM stayed profitable despite putting $15.7bn into reserves, which are now likely to cover even the losses from a protracted downturn. Low rates will be a headwind for revenues in the near term, but JPM's wholesale franchises have grown stronger and will provide an offset. At $100.01, with a return to a 16% ROTCE and a 12x P/E in 2023, the annualized return would be 13.8%, including a 3.6% Dividend Yield."
4359053,2020-07-17,JPMorgan: Navigating The Apocalypse In A Brink's Truck,"JPMorgan is preparing for things to get very, very bad. Listen to what Jaime Dimon is telling you; he's pretty smart. They have already pumped up provisions for bad loans very high and added another $16 billion in extra capital to that. Just in case. The outlook for JPMorgan is good regardless, as they have taken their hits up front and likely will not need to provision for any more losses. The outlook for the rest of us is much more cloudy."

JPMorgan's quarterly dividend of $0.90 is over double the $0.38 level from which it was last cut to $0.05 in the 2008-2009 financial crisis. So far, there seems to be no sign of a dividend cut in the wake of this current crisis, so long as it meets upcoming EPS estimates of $1.70-2.00. Low funding costs and diverse sources of yield are likely to help JPM get its return on asset rate back above 1% and possibly support a dividend increase next year. In this article, I show a series of charts going back to JPM's 2000 merger with Chase, and try and project forward where the company might go over the next 20 years."

I expect the dichotomy between consumer (softer) and corporate (stronger) to be in place once again, although not to the same extent. When it comes to the financial services sector, I believe that now is not the time to be cheap, which is why I favor JPM over its peers."

The organization is still earning a 15 percent return on shareholders equity and this with a solid capital foundation, a well stocked loan-loss reserve, and a cash load. Although loan defaults will not peak until the second half of 2021, the organization seems well protected to keep up its performance over the coming years."
4378877,2020-10-13,JPMorgan Review: Good Execution In Challenging Environment,"On earnings day, JPMorgan topped consensus estimates by a healthy margin. The major themes were in line with my expectations. The consumer segment continues to suffer from low activity and an unfavorable interest rate environment. However, in institutional, JPMorgan continues to perform better than its peers, making more of sector-wide tailwinds. Third quarter results, which I believe were much better than expected despite the challenging landscape, support my more bullish views on JPM."

Q3 earnings benefited from JPM's diversified franchise, and were flat y/y excluding litigation and provisions; EPS was up 9% year-on-year. Management indicated Net Charge Offs are unlikely to rise materially until H1, and JPM has over-reserved by $10bn vs. the Fed's Base Case. Net Interest Income is likely to have stabilized and has potential to grow; we believe ROTCE may end up in the low-teens for 2020 and 2021. At $100.75, shares are at less than 9x 2019 EPS and can deliver a total return of 52% (15% annualised) by 2023. Dividend Yield is 3.6%. Buy."

First and most attention-gathering, JPMorgan reduced its loan loss reserves by $5.2 billion, reflecting the fact that the bank had been ultraconservative in building up reserves last year. Loan growth was very moderate as the businesses just did not seek out bank borrowing to support their efforts to weather out the economic recession and pandemic.

A one-off $5.2bn reserve release was a key contributor; reserves are now only $7bn (3.5% of Tangible Book Value) above the start of 2020. Strong revenues were primarily driven by record activity in Corporate & Investment Banking; Net Interest Revenues fell again from Q4. JPM's balance sheet is still constrained by regulations, and it had to issue $1.5bn of preferred stock in Q1; only some relief may come in GSIB. At $151.21, shares are trading at 2.3x P/TBV, and we expect a long-term ROTCE of 16%, which will limit annualized return to less than 10%."

Historical data show that buying banking stocks near or below 1.35x price to TBV has provided overwhelming odds for large return to risk ratios. At its current price ~$165, JPMorgan Chase is valued at ~2.5x of its TBV and the margin of safety to invest is thin even though JPM is undoubtedly a great company.

Profits fell sequentially in Q2. Interest revenues are under pressure, and revenues in the investment bank are falling from their cyclical high. Expenses have risen again, and reserve releases are mostly done. JPM's recent expansions into new markets point to excess capital.

BAC's P/E is higher because likely to perform better in a hot economy with high rates and because of potentially larger buybacks.

A perusal of JPM financials shows 33% more non-interest income than BAC, meaning less help from rising rates but the safety of multiple income streams for long-term investors. JPM offers a 2.42% yield but promises only modest buybacks while investing for growth and to compete with fintech startups. CEO Jamie Dimon is a strong leader and spokesman for the banking industry and has guided JPM into a dominant global position. In an environment when all banks seem too cheap, JPM may have the most to gain from its 11 PE if bank valuations are rerated upward."
4479254,2022-01-12,JPMorgan Stock: It's A Buy Regardless Of Its Q4 Report,"The Q4 earnings report's prospects are analyzed in the article, although we don't see any surprises and don't think analysts will change their full-year outlook based on the release. The recovering debt markets and the slack in the M&A space could sustain earnings growth. Pricing and valuation models suggest that the stock will probably beat the market this year in the midst of a bullish outlook on broad-based equities."
4480180,2022-01-18,Is JPMorgan Stock A Buy Or Sell After Recent Earnings?,"JPM shares closed down 6.3% on Friday after Q4 2021 results. We believe investors were disappointed by the outlook on 2022 and beyond. Management reiterated that return on equity will likely be below target in 2022, and their comments indicate this may continue into 2023. Headwinds include a slow recovery in interest income, lower investment banking activity, higher expenses, and higher capital requirements. Q4 saw earnings (excluding reserve releases) continuing to trend down, investment bank revenues falling, and card income under pressure. With shares at $157.89, we expect an exit price of $194 and a total return of 35% (8.4% annualized) by 2025 year-end. Avoid."
4480135,2022-01-18,JPMorgan Chase Makes The Move To The Digital Future,"JPMorgan has dedicated itself to the future as it ups spending for technology in the future, technology to take on the explosion brought on by FinTech. In its latest announcement of earnings, JPMorgan has stated that its investments in future technologies are going to drive performance to meet competitive pressures. This move may represent a 'tipping point"""" for large banks as JPMorgan seems to be leading the financial world into a transition toward the digital future. And this digital future will focus on building the payments system and on competing against the FinTechs that are changing the platform nature of banking and finance."
4488366,2022-02-18,JPMorgan - Paying The Cost To Be The Boss,"JPMorgan's fourth quarter results were fine, but not exceptional, with beats on net interest income and fee income offset by higher spending, leading to a minor pre-provision profit beat. Management surprised the Street with significantly higher spending for 2022 and 2023, with 2022 opex going up about 9%. JPMorgan is choosing to use its exceptional profitability to reinvest in the business, looking to ensure future share gains and leadership in areas like digital banking, cards, and payments. I can appreciate investors being nervous about this investment push - the expenses are certain, the benefits are not - but JPMorgan has an established track record of TBV growth and superior ROTCEs. I believe JPMorgan is now priced for double-digit expected annualized returns, and while near-term outperformance will be harder given weaker operating leverage, the long-term story is strong."

We standardized the stock's valuation metrics and plotted them continuously to find that the stock is undervalued. An array of macroeconomic variables are shifting, which could alter the stock's trajectory. Dividend yield and ROA metrics have been shown to dictate the stock's closing price, and they're subject to change amid rising wages and a more stringent stress test. Volatility and inflation remain concerns but the root cause is changing."

Preferred stocks offer investors the chance to capture much higher yields than most common stocks offer. Given the year-to-date selloff in preferreds, yields have become much more attractive in recent weeks. JPMorgan Chase has a series of preferred stocks, one of which is among my top three favorites in the entire preferred universe."

JPMorgan has been a strong outperformer in the banking sector, while Citi has struggled in recent years and continues a multiyear restructuring program meant to drive double-digit ROTCEs. Loan growth should accelerate from here, with JPMorgan likely to see better middle-market loan growth, while both banks are poised to benefit from strong consumer spending and healthy credit. Both Citi and JPMorgan look undervalued at today's level but offer very different risk/reward profiles."

Excluding one-off credit reserve builds/releases, profits were stable sequentially and similar to the level in pre-COVID Q1 2020. Profits are normalizing after their COVID-year boost, but JPM businesses are otherwise stable, loan growth is accelerating and yields are rising. Q1 results support the 16% Return on Tangible Common Equity we assume, which implies a 11.3x P/E. The Dividend Yield is 3.2%. With shares at $126.12, we expect an exit price of $198 and a total return of 73% (16.8% annualized) by 2025 year-end. Buy."

But JPMorgan's valuations are unattractive as compared to peers, and there is near-term earnings pressure as the company has signaled its intention to invest for future growth. I assign a Hold rating to JPM, as a recovery in its stock price to $150 implying a +21% gain in the short term seems difficult."

In the future, JPMorgan Chase & Co. may be looked at more as an information giant, like Amazon.com, Inc. or Alphabet, Inc., focusing on the building of platforms and networks. Jamie Dimon is seeing the future of JPMorgan Chase & Co. as a technology giant, one that focuses on scale and inclusion. But, in doing so, Mr. Dimon stresses that the results and performance of the bank will be based upon building repeat relationships, quality employees, and a longer-run outlook. Furthermore, the changes in banking must go on despite the fact that the short-term outlook for the economy and the world may be one associated with an atmosphere similar to a hurricane."

We think the current dip may seem attractive to long-term investors, as JPM last traded at a considerable discount against its 5Y and 10Y mean. But, investors are urged to layer in over time, given JPM's bearish bias. Also, we don't think the market has priced in an extended recessionary scenario. We rate JPM as a Buy with a price target of $126."

4522687,2022-07-11,Is JPMorgan Chase Stock A Buy Before Upcoming Earnings?,"JPMorgan will report its Q2 results in about a week. Some earnings growth versus Q1 is expected, despite a slowdown in investment banking. Net interest income could grow going forward, and the low valuation also should be beneficial for total returns. JPM did not fare too well during the stress test, which is why no dividend increase has been announced so far."
4523376,2022-07-14,JPMorgan Chase: A Rough Second Quarter,JPMorgan Chase recently reported second quarter earnings and missed estimates for both revenue and EPS.

4523477,2022-07-15,JPMorgan Chase: Jamie Dimon's Warning,"During the bank's July 14 earnings call, JPM's CEO, Jamie Dimon, warned that JPM will shrink risk assets (i.e., loans) in response to """"ridiculous regulatory requirements."""" Dimon is concerned that """"capricious, arbitrary"""" capital adequacy requirements will result in less capital for loans, and that's """"not good for the United States economy."""" U.S. regulators appear to be making the same mistake they made under Obama: Banks then met higher capital ratio demands by a slowdown in lending. Outcome then? Anemic economic growth. Dimon just warned investors that the nation's biggest lender will """"drive down substantially"""" risk assets, notably mortgages, which means higher rates for borrowers and fewer loan alternatives. While I will continue to accumulate JPM shares for its rich dividend, I am troubled by regulatory demands that are further evidence that Washington policy makers are imperiling economic growth."

However, dip buyers have decisively rejected the post-earnings sell-off, helping JPM recover all its post-earnings losses. As a result, we believe the market is looking past its Q2 challenges. Our analysis suggests that JPM's valuation remains attractive. Also, the consensus estimates suggest an earnings recovery is in store from FY23. The post-earnings recovery after the initial sell-off has strengthened our thesis on JPM's buying support. As a result, we believe the worst sell-off is over for the bank. Therefore, we reiterate our Buy rating on JPM."

The bank's stock is down almost 30% YTD and now trades at a P/E below x10, P/S below x3 and P/B below x1.5. JPM is currently valued like a """"normal"""" bank, not like a leader.

The market has likely priced in a mild recession for JPM. Management also thinks a mild recession is more likely than a deeper one. JPMorgan's net interest income should continue to benefit from the Fed's rate hikes, mitigating the impact on its non-interest income growth.

Instead of trying to predict the earnings for a complicated juggernaut like JPMorgan Chase, I suggest you focus on the basics. Buying good banks at book value has always been a no-brainer to me (and I assume to you too). But the problem is that good banks are rarely for sale at book value. So, the real question is: how much premium should you pay? And for excellent banks like JPMorgan, I’m willing to pay a premium of up to 10x of its dividends, leading to a target share price of $95."

Although, investment banking fees for the quarter are likely down more than 50% year over year, the bank's global market division is poised to deliver strong results. Analysts’ expectations are reasonable. But given the negativity surrounding Credit Suisse, investors should consider that JPMorgan Chase stock might be priced for an earnings miss.

Consumer banking profits improved sequentially thanks to higher rates and credit loss reserves actually declined, a pleasant surprise. While IB fee revenue was hard hit, volatile markets boosted trading income. JPMorgan Chase benefits from higher rates, which outweigh higher credit costs, and the firm should be done building capital by Q1 2023.

Credit quality remains fine for now, and JPMorgan has the capacity to start socking away meaningfully more capital into reserves. Management has been signaling more flexibility on opex spending in 2023 and could surprise to the good with more operating leverage. I believe JPMorgan's share gains in retail banking, middle-market banking, and payments/corporate treasury services may yet be going underappreciated by many investors. A long-term core earnings growth rate of 4% can still support a decent return from here; in a softer-landing scenario, JPMorgan isn't the best investment choice, but if the economy underperforms, JPMorgan could do relatively better."

Strong Net Interest Income, driven by both higher rates and loan growth, more than offset a modest fall in Non-Interest Revenues. JPMorgan now has more than enough credit reserves for a mild recession, and will likely remain profitable even in a bad one. Buybacks are resuming after JPMorgan hit a capital ratio target early. The dividend represents a 2.8% yield now and should rise further. With JPMorgan Chase & Co. shares at $142.94, we expect a total return of 40% (12.5% annualized) by end of 2025. Buy."
4569757,2023-01-13,JPMorgan Chase: Huge Earnings Beat,JPMorgan beat estimates easily with its Q4 report. The company is well-positioned to benefit from a rising rates environment. Profits are pretty strong and the valuation is far from high.
4570383,2023-01-17,JPMorgan Executing Well In Challenging Times And Still Undervalued,"JPMorgan posted a good set of earnings for the fourth quarter, with a nearly 10% beat at the pre-provision line and slightly better performance with loan growth and deposit costs. Loan growth is likely to continue slowing from here, while deposit beta is likely to continue to increase, creating some near-term growth headwinds. Management seems willing to be more flexible on its spending plans if revenue slows more than expected, and capital is now sufficient to restart share buybacks. JPMorgan should be able to generate long-term core earnings growth in the mid-single-digits, supporting a near-term fair value into the low-$150s."
4570322,2023-01-17,JPMorgan Chase: Be Patient While Others Are Greedy,"JPMorgan didn't surprise us as management outlined its """"mild recession"""" outlook in its Q4 earnings card. We highlighted in our previous article that CEO Jamie Dimon's downcast messaging in the media was not in line with his strategists' commentary. Investors need to temper their expectations of the NII tailwinds as we could be near the end of the Fed's rate hikes. Buying sentiments have improved, but investors need to position their exposure appropriately for a Fed resolved to meet its price stability goal."
4573400,2023-01-29,JPMorgan: Investors Are Worried About Its Capital Trajectory,"JPMorgan is best of breed and long-term shareholders have done exceptionally well holding the stock. JPMorgan is a defensive, flight-to-quality and outperforms both in recessions and in the long term. The key risk currently is rapidly rising capital requirements. The most concerning aspect is the recent speech by the Fed's new Vice Chair for Supervision. JPM capital requirements may need to increase materially in the next few years."
4579602,2023-02-17,JPMorgan: Ray Dalio Is Betting Big,"Recently, a 13F filing revealed that JPMorgan Chase & Co. stock was Ray Dalio's second-biggest fourth quarter buy. The rest of the top five was rounded out by other financials and an S&P 500 fund. The moves weren't surprising at all, because today's macroeconomic climate is relatively friendly to banks. JPMorgan is much like other banks in its reaction to monetary policy, but it has intriguing characteristics like large investments in AI. In this article, I explain why I consider JPMorgan stock a good value at today's prices."
4579673,2023-02-18,JPMorgan Chase: Buy For 2023 And Beyond,"JPMorgan closed FY 2022 with approximately $46.2 billion of pre-tax earnings, which is the second highest income for the bank in over a decade. On the backdrop of a likely rebound in investment banking activity, paired with a strong net interest rate margin, I am bullish for JPM's FY 2023. Personally, I update my EPS expectations for the largest US bank through 2025; and I now calculate a fair implied share price equal to $219.25."
4580072,2023-02-20,JPMorgan Chase: Well Positioned To Work Out The Decent Potential,"JPMorgan posted solid financials on the prints, however, with sourness reflecting the revision of future macro outlook. I believe the US economy still has a margin of safety against the ongoing headwinds, allowing JPM to feel relatively sound with its diversified business lines. Although the valuation of JPM offers a moderate upside, I believe my bullish call will pay out once the positive outlook works out."
4581773,2023-02-24,JPMorgan Chase: The Price I'll Start Buying,"Purchasing good banks like JPMorgan near tangible book value has always been profitable for me. However, they're seldom available at such bargain prices. Therefore, the more practical question is: How much of a premium would I be willing to pay? I'm happy to pay a premium of up to 10 times its dividends, which translates to a target share price of about $115 for JPMorgan under current conditions."

With a fortress balance sheet, paired with strong profitability, JPM not only appears positioned to navigate market distress but also positioned to thrive. For now, on the backdrop of a favorable interest rate environment, I continue to expect an EPS expansion for JPM through 2025.

While the highly speculative opportunities may not be in JPM, the reward/risk looks attractive after the selloff."
4588781,2023-03-20,JPMorgan Chase: Panic-Driven Deposits Provide Profitability Tailwinds,"JPM continues to command depositors' and market analysts' confidence in deposit stability and forward execution. This sentiment is demonstrated by the """"deluge of deposits"""" flowing into JPM, along with other banks, potentially helping boost its Net Interest Income beyond $73B in FY2023. Combined with Moody's A1 credit rating and JPM's excellent liquidity sources, the bank continues to reign supreme with a lower unrealized loss-to-equity ratio of 5.6%. Investors may consider adding here if it consequently reduces or matches their dollar cost averages. Otherwise, with the rapidly declining sentiments, we may see JPM testing the low $100s again."

JPMorgan is acquiring loans and securities from First Republic at a meaningful discount to their accounting value, driving immediate tangible book accretion. Like the SVB deal, the FDIC is providing loss-sharing agreements on the loan book and low-cost fixed-rate financing to facilitate the deal. Acquiring First Republic could be an invaluable boost to JPMorgan's efforts to grow its asset management and high net worth businesses, but maintaining those relationships is critical and not guaranteed.

Diamond Sports has since filed for bankruptcy, and the sale may be declared illegal by the court. Investors should not be alarmed, however. The assets were guaranteed by Sinclair, so it, not Morgan, would be liable for restitution for any illegal preferential transfers. The case instead is a testament to JPMorgan's strong risk-management culture, as it ensured its guarantee had recourse to Sinclair's assets, not just those in the subsidiary. And those assets are sufficient to pay what Morgan is owed. Morgan's decision to underwrite and fund Sinclair's RSN merger 4 years ago has been vindicated - it reaped substantial returns on a deal others were afraid to touch, without compromising its strong risk management.

Valuations for JPMorgan resemble the 2000, 2008, and 2020 periods right before recession. Insider sales and waning momentum in the stock rally are additional concerns, leading me to downgrade my rating to Sell."
4671842,2024-02-21,JPMorgan Chase: Even The Banking Leader Needs A Break,"JPMorgan Chase investors have outperformed their financial sector peers since the market bottom in October/November. The bank expects $90B in full-year net interest income in 2024 but cautions that it has likely reached its peak. JPMorgan anticipates a more robust market environment in 2024 and believes it is well-positioned to leverage the resurgence in the private credit market. I explain why JPM remains a solid bet, given its scale and market leadership - but not at this valuation. Even a top banking stock like JPM needs to take a well-deserved break occasionally for bullish optimism to dissipate."
4672447,2024-02-22,JPMorgan Chase: Stronger Net Interest Income Could Boost The Stock,"JPMorgan Chase presents a compelling buy opportunity due to its strong financial performance in 2023 and low exposure to commercial real estate. The bank's net interest income has significantly increased, fueled by higher interest rates and the strategic impact of the First Republic acquisition. JPMorgan Chase is well-positioned to generate additional profits in a higher interest rate environment, thanks to its """"fortress balance sheet"""" and limited exposure to unrealized losses."
4672935,2024-02-23,JPMorgan: Fairly Valued Despite Positive Fundamentals,"JPMorgan's ten-year median net interest margin is steady at 1.9%, reflecting the bank's diversification and consistent loan quality. JPMorgan's net charge-off ratio shows relative consistency, indicating stable credit loss management in line with the other big four banks. JPMorgan's efficiency ratio has mostly hovered around 60%, close to industry averages. JPMorgan has maintained a healthy loan-to-deposit ratio under 100% over the past decade, indicating stable and cost-effective funding sources. Expected CAGR of 7.1% for JPMorgan over five years, with projections based on normalized financial ratios and current valuation metrics, leading to a 'hold' recommendation."

4680276,2024-03-25,JPMorgan Chase: Time To Take Some Profit,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. had a strong showing in earnings in 2023. The article argues that many of the catalysts that drove JPMorgan Chase's earnings growth in 2023 are unlikely to continue into 2024, leading to concerns of over-earning and a potential decline in profitability. At the same time, the stock may be fully valued or even overvalued, leaving margin of safety."
4680639,2024-03-27,JPMorgan Chase: The Fed Put May Propel Shares To New Records,"JPMorgan's bull run is expected to continue, as the company is enjoying multiple tailwinds on both macro and company levels. On top of fundamental strength, I highlight the renaissance of the fed put, which could potentially significantly change the risk perception of investors towards financial institutions. With a more favorable perception of JPM's risk profile, the bank's valuation may be set for a rerating, potentially trading up to the valuation of a typical GARP stock. I view a >$300/ share price as possible, projecting a P/E of around ~20x. This would be a valuation similar to the price multiple seen in the broader U.S. equity market."
4681250,2024-03-29,JPMorgan: This Banking Giant Has A Very Decent Upside Potential,"Thesis Update: JPMorgan's stock has risen by 15.57% since my previous article.

The book value (BV) and tangible book value (TBV) valuations on JPM are 1.9x and 2.32x (stock trading around $200) which are the highest BV and TBV valuations of the big banks. JPM recently boosted their dividend and looks like it is buying back stock again, so that could help Q1 ’24."

4683801,2024-04-15,JPMorgan: Why Being Cautious Was Right And Still Is Right,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. investors who chased its recent upside were likely stunned by last week's sharp pullback. JPMorgan maintained its NII guidance, but the market likely asked for more. JPMorgan investors must be realistic and not fight against the Fed (potentially cutting rates). With JPMorgan Chase still not valued attractively, I explain the level that will excite me more."
4685523,2024-04-23,JPMorgan: Solid Dividend Growth Stock With More Upside Potential,"JPMorgan has outpaced the S&P 500 in total return due to its strong price growth from growing revenues across segments. Although the starting dividend yield is only 2.5%, JPM has great dividend growth metrics with 9 years of consecutive raises. Despite trading at a higher valuation, there is still upside potential. My dividend discount model estimates a fair value of $225 per share. The dividend has grown at a CAGR of 10.8% over the last decade, making this a great dividend growth stock."
4689313,2024-05-04,JPMorgan: A 6% Preferred Dividend Yield Remains Appealing,"JPMorgan reported strong net profit in Q1 with a total net interest income of $23.1B. Loan loss provisions are increasing but still a fraction of total earnings profile, indicating stability in the US banking sector. Series EE preferred shares issued by JPMorgan offer a 6% fixed preferred dividend yield, making them an attractive investment option."
4690929,2024-05-08,JPMorgan: Investing In The Best,"JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s latest earnings report showed strong results, but it was a lack of guidance change that could indicate weaker results later in the year. JPMorgan's valuation doesn't make it a screaming deal, but the long-term investor can still look to dollar-cost average into a position. The recent dividend increase and growing dividend over the last decade can make it a great fit for a dividend growth investor."

JPMorgan aims to open 500 new branches by 2027, focusing on low-income and rural areas, potentially adding $9.11 billion in revenue. JPMorgan is the best-capitalized among major banks, holding 12.86% of total US deposits, more than Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

JPM has a tough compare with Q2 ’23 when revenue and EPS grew 34% and 54%, respectively. JPM also has tougher a compare vs. ’23 in Q3 ’24. Citigroup’s constant allure over the past 5 years has been its discount to book value and tangible book value that it constantly traded at when the stock was hanging around the high $39s to low $50s. On Friday morning, July 12th, ’24, Citi sell-side consensus is expecting $1.39 in earnings per share on $20.074 billion in revenue for expected y-o-y growth of 5% and 3% respectively."
4703810,2024-07-12,JPMorgan Chase: Building Consistency And Shareholder Trust,"JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s second quarter earnings report fell short of expectations, but the stock price only dropped slightly. Management is focused on maintaining a return on equity of 17% or higher, with plans to outperform the industry even in a downturn. Concerns about potential tax increases, an inverted yield curve, and rising deposit costs are being addressed. This bank easily meets any higher capital requirements that the Federal Reserve may require. Clearly, the bank management sees challenges ahead and intends to have a solution to those challenges if they appear."

The bank's Q2 2024 results significantly benefitted from the Visa share sale transaction, with an ROTCE of 28%, or 20% excluding the one-off effect. Against the expectations for lower Fed rates, profitability is likely to decline to the bank's medium-term target of 17%. Naked long investors are likely looking at a high single-digit return, while a covered call strategy may produce a low-double-digit gain. Key risks in selling covered calls include limiting your upside while keeping all the downside, coupled with the Fed not cutting rates as fast as markets currently price in."
4715542,2024-08-19,JPMorgan: Getting Closer To The Peak,"JPMorgan Chase has seen significant growth in interest income and loans, leading to impressive ROTCE, but faces risks from potential changes in interest rates. The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates, potentially impacting JPMorgan's net interest income and overall revenue growth. While JPMorgan's diversified revenue streams may offer some resilience, the stock's valuation and potential macroeconomic headwinds suggest it may not be a compelling investment at this time."
4716056,2024-08-20,JPMorgan: Even Better As Interest Rates Drop,"JPMorgan's strong performance has been driven by high net interest income and a favorable interest rate environment. Concerns linger about future earnings due to potential decreases in net interest income, but I think their diversified revenue model and strategic investments provide optimism. Lower interest rates could actually benefit JPMorgan through reduced loan charge-offs and strong performance in non-lending operations, supporting the potential for an upside in the stock price. I think shares remain a strong buy."
4716387,2024-08-22,JPMorgan: Attractive Fixed Income Securities,"JPMorgan's fundamentals are strong, with positive growth across its four main segments, particularly in Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. JPMorgan demonstrates excellent financial stability and strong management with top rankings in operational efficiency, ROA, and ROE. JPMorgan's bonds are a superior choice due to their higher coupon rate, credit rating, asset claim priority, and government protection in times of liquidation."

4720636,2024-09-12,JPMorgan Chase Stock: The Tough Get Going,"JPMorgan's recent stock pullback is a buying opportunity. The bank's long-term return on equity remains above average, as this management has long outperformed the industry. JPMorgan Chase's current price-earnings ratio of less than 12 is modest, especially compared to high-fliers trading at over 30. Holding JPM stock is advisable due to its superior management and long-term industry outperformance.

Year-over-year, NII growth was modest at 3%, and net income decreased by -1%. Yet, the bank saw great momentum in non-interest revenue, growing 12%. Although the CEO thinks the stock multiple is inflated, I believe it is fairly valued, and given the bank's strong positioning, it is worth providing it with a buy rating."

The bank reported 3Q net income exceeding $50 billion annually and maintains a strong CET1 capital ratio of 15.3%. Shareholder returns are robust, with $3.6 billion in dividends and significant share repurchases, contributing to a 6% annual return. The main risk is increased competition from new banks offering higher interest rates, potentially impacting JPMorgan's growth."

Despite declining net interest margins, JPM's diversified revenue streams and asset management growth may support the bank in the instance of further rate cuts. Macroeconomic factors and potential rate cuts pose risks, but looser monetary policy could benefit the Company's asset management and capital raising activities."
4726895,2024-10-15,"JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo, And Economy In Good Shape","JPMorgan Chase & Co. produced strong ROE and ROTCE of 19% and 16% in Q3 2024, despite a slight decline from Q3 2023. Wells Fargo also maintained double-digit ROE and ROTCE numbers, though not as high as JPMorgan Chase. Early Q3 earnings reports suggest continued economic growth, with Jamie Dimon highlighting strong business and financial results. CEO Charles Scharf at Wells Fargo seems to concur. These big bands seem to be doing well and seem to indicate that the economy is doing well at this time."
4727248,2024-10-16,JPMorgan Chase: Recent Over-Earning And The Outlook From Here,"JPMorgan has a strong track record of generating a double-digit return on tangible common equity. JPMorgan has significantly outperformed U.S. bank peers since the Fed began raising interest rates in 2022, with the bank seeing above-average NIM expansion in that time. JPMorgan is still over-earning relative to management's long-term ROTCE target, but at ~12.1x current earnings, the stock may have a credible path to reasonable long-term returns."

Bank of America reported 1% y-o-y net revenue growth which generated -10% EPS growth, which was the 4th straight quarter of y-o-y negative EPS growth.

Despite solid Q3 results and upward revised 2024 guidance, potential revenue and net income declines in 2025 suggest limited equity gains. The high current valuation, with P/E at 13.4x and P/BV at 1.8x, indicates investors are already optimistic, warranting a cautious stance. Analysts' consensus target price is USD 232.07, with modest upside potential; CEO Jamie Dimon advises caution on stock repurchases at high valuations."
4735249,2024-11-09,JPMorgan: Strong Results Make 6% Preferred Shares Still Appealing,"JPMorgan remains highly profitable, with strong net interest income and a robust CET1 ratio of 15.3%, despite increased loan loss provisions. Preferred shares offer a steady income stream, with a 6% fixed dividend yield, making them attractive for income-focused investors. The Series EE preferred shares are appealing, but currently slightly above my buying range; I would consider buying at $25/share. I hold a small position in JPMorgan common shares but haven't increased it due to the stock's rise beyond my limit price (and I haven't chased it)."
4737868,2024-11-15,Bank of America And JPMorgan Chase: Deregulation Tailwinds Ahead,"JPM and BAC have benefited from a sharp rally post-election, both outperforming the average financial sector. I will argue JPM and BAC rallies are far from over given the potential deregulation expected from the upcoming Trump administration. Leading banks like BAC and JPM are especially well-positioned to benefit due to their scale, profitability, and financial strength. Their current P/E ratios admittedly appear elevated, but investors should also examine other valuation metrics (such as dividend yields). All told, some valuation premium is well justified given the potential for sustained growth ahead."
4741164,2024-11-29,JPMorgan: Pullback In Preferred Shares Gives A Buying Opportunity,"JPMorgan Chase only derived 55% of its Q3 2024 revenue from net interest income, making it less exposed to Fed rate cuts compared to smaller lenders. The bank's series MM preferred shares have lost ground since September 2024 as expectations for interest rates have moved higher. I expect potential tariffs by President Trump to only boost inflation in the short term, allowing the Fed to reach its neutral rate by the end of 2026. An attractive current yield and some capital appreciation potential should allow investors to attain a very low double-digit total return by the end of 2026. Along with the size and effect of new tariffs, a key risk to consider is the uncertain relationship between Fed rate cuts and preferred stock prices."
4744453,2024-12-16,Don't Get Fooled By The Recent Drop In Price In JPMorgan's Preferred Stocks,"JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s preferred stocks trading below par are not attractive investments due to their overvaluation compared to company bonds and peer issues. Despite a 10% price drop since September 2024, the preferred stocks still yield lower than similar-rated securities from other issuers. JPMorgan Chase's strong financial condition ensures preferred dividends are safe, but the current pricing does not justify a """"Buy"""" rating. I recommend a """"Hold"""" rating for these preferred stocks, primarily due to their recent price decline and potential for technical correction."
4744934,2024-12-17,JPMorgan Chase: Well-Positioned For The Point In The Cycle,"JPMorgan Chase has shown strong financial performance with significant revenue and earnings growth, despite higher credit costs and cautious economic outlooks. The bank's strategic investments in technology and AI, along with expansion plans, indicate robust future growth potential. JPMorgan Chase maintains a strong balance sheet with low loan-to-deposit and loan-to-asset ratios, enhancing its stability against economic downturns. Despite its strengths, I remain cautious about investing in banks now due to potential economic challenges and high market valuations."

Growth drivers include higher investment banking and asset management fees, net interest income, and potentially lower credit loss provisions due to a strong job market. The outlook for 2025 is positive, with potential benefits from less regulation under the new president and healthy economic growth in the US. Despite being a high-quality bank, JPM trades at a premium valuation, making it less attractive for new investments and income investors due to a lower dividend yield."

The bank's 2025 NII guidance of $94 billion exceeded expectations, reflecting a resilient U.S. economy and loan volume growth. Each division performed exceptionally well, with CIB and AWM showing impressive ROE and net income growth, driven by market gains and fee income. JPMorgan is firing on all cylinders, but JPM stock's valuation at ~2.6x tangible book value reflects its quality; I will add more on dips."
4749987,2025-01-16,JPMorgan Q4 Earnings: Time To Stop Worrying Over Mr. Dimon's Retirement,"JPMorgan Chase posted strong Q4 results, with EPS up 58% y/y and IB revenues up 46% y/y, beating analyst estimates. Investment Banking is expected to drive growth in 2025, supported by a favorable deal environment and increased market volatility under Trump 2.0. Concerns about Jamie Dimon's departure are premature; the focus should be on JPM's ambitious European expansion with Chase, which shows promising growth potential. Despite being 14% overvalued, JPM's strong momentum and earnings performance justify a HOLD rating, anticipating short-term price action to the upside."

The steepening yield curve and higher loan volumes led JPMorgan to provide an optimistic NII guidance of $94 billion for FY 25. Despite a slight overvaluation, JPMorgan remains a """"buy"""" due to strong return on tangible common equity and potential regulatory easing. Risks include market volatility normalization and higher rates affecting other business areas, but JPMorgan's diversified portfolio mitigates these concerns."

4750658,2025-01-20,JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Watch The Federal Reserve,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. posted strong results, but future performance hinges on Federal Reserve policies. The Federal Reserve is the prime inflation fighting agent. The Federal Reserve's structure ensures long-term stability. However, resignations can undo that assumption. President Biden's Federal Reserve appointments contributed to declining inflation. Future banking stock performance may be influenced by potential expansionary policies.

Despite impressive revenue and EPS growth, the stock appears overvalued, with P/E and P/B ratios disconnected from historical growth levels. Technical analysis shows a strong uptrend with multiple support levels and no resistance, signaling continued bullish momentum. Given the bullish technicals but high valuation, JPMorgan stock is currently a hold."
4751692,2025-01-24,JPMorgan Chase: Where Do You Go From The Top?,"JPMorgan Chase produced one of the best quarterly results of its peer growth relative to expectations. Underlying conditions are improving, and management meaningfully boosted net interest income guidance for 2025, but regulatory reform could be an even bigger boost to longer-term growth and profitability. JPMorgan has multiple drivers for long-term growth, including organic branch expansion, growth in capital markets, payments, and asset management, and tech-driven share takeaway. Regulatory reform could drive a meaningful sector-wide rerating, but as-is JPMorgan shares look more fairly valued for the excellent bank that it is."
4755850,2025-02-07,JPMorgan Chase: Using Preferred Shares To Speculate On Lower Interest Rates,"JPMorgan's Q4 results showed strong financial performance with a net profit of $14B, making its common stock attractive despite a 13x earnings multiple. The Series LL preferred shares offer a 5.64% dividend yield with low call risk, making them a stable income source amid potential lower interest rates. The preferred dividends are well covered, requiring less than 2% of net profit, indicating excellent financial health and reliability for preferred dividend investors. Investing in Series LL preferred shares could yield high single-digit returns if interest rates decrease, offering both income and potential capital gains."
4761217,2025-02-24,JPMorgan Chase: Bulls Underestimate Headwinds Ahead,"This article downgrades my rating on JPM stock to HOLD. Its Q4 earnings exceeded expectations but also helped to mask future uncertainties. The earnings are unusually good, thanks to the surge in non-interest income, decrease in provision, and also share repurchases. All the drivers face large uncertainties in the near future due to inflation, interest rate uncertainties, and also geopolitics. The current valuation premiums will also reduce the potency of future share buybacks – if any."

Provisioning already reflects some deterioration in macroeconomic fundamentals, making large provision builds in Q1 2025 unlikely. I present a bull and bear case for the Series JJ Preferred shares. I think the bull case has more merits in light of anticipated Fed policy, ranking the JPM Series JJ preferred shares a Buy. Key risks to consider include an explosion in yield spreads relative to treasuries during market crashes and the uncertain timing of Fed policy normalization."

The bank's diversified structure across Consumer Banking, Commercial & Investment Banking, and Asset Management contributes to its strong market position and operational advances. Despite solid performance, JPM's current valuation is ordinary, with a shareholder yield of 4.9% and a P/B ratio above historical averages. I rate JPM a hold, but to be clear, that is a relative rating versus a market of stocks that mostly look worse."

4773718,2025-04-08,JPMorgan Q1 Preview: Numerous Inflection Points Could Materialize,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. is set to report its Q1 results on Friday the 11th. According to sampled data, the street estimates $44.05 billion in revenue and $4.64 GAAP EPS. A look-back analysis suggests that JPMorgan's NII margins likely remained high during Q1. However, growing macro and credit tensions might shift provisions upward. Global deal-making has been docile, likely impacting JPMorgan's investment banking division, yet some of the risks might've been counteracted by favourable commercial lending circumstances. Trading revenue could settle lower amid stock market pressures. Opportunities exist in fixed income. However, we see a break in market and securities revenue occurring. Although we expect dividends to grow, we think JPMorgan's valuation metrics are slightly concerning, especially from a relative standpoint."
4774107,2025-04-09,JPMorgan Earnings Preview: Tough Compares Meet Harder Capital Markets,"JPMorgan will report their Q1 ’25 financial results before the opening bell on Friday, April 11th, 2025. Consensus estimates for the bank giant are expecting $4.61 in earnings per share on $44.1 billion in revenue for expected y-o-y growth in EPS of exactly 0% (flat y-o-y) on -1% revenue growth. With the drop in JPM’s stock price from $280 late in ’24 to $235 today (after the big rally), the P/E has compressed a little bit on JPM, as the EPS estimates haven’t changed much with the market turmoil."
4774065,2025-04-09,JPMorgan Chase: Possible Stagflation Would Crush Valuation,JPMorgan Chase has dipped 24% from its 52-week high on market tariff concerns. A US recession is now the base case for 2025 as CPI and core PCE could be set for a sustained rise on a ramping tariff regime. There could be a further retrenchment on JPM's valuation in the short term and a decline in financial performance in the medium term.
4774506,2025-04-11,JPMorgan: Still The King Of Banking,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported strong Q1 earnings, beating expectations with a 4% revenue and 6% EPS beat, despite macroeconomic uncertainties. The bank's commercial and investment banking unit excelled, with investment banking fees up 12% and overall markets & securities revenue rising 19%. JPMorgan's asset & wealth management unit saw net revenues grow 12% and net earnings rise 23%, benefiting from a 15% increase in assets under management. Despite economic uncertainties, JPMorgan's strong capitalization and shareholder returns make it a solid hold or buy, trading at a reasonable valuation."
4774487,2025-04-11,JPMorgan's Q1 Review: A Fantastic Quarter,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported a Q1 2025 EPS of $5.07, beating market expectations by 9.2%, driven by strong top-line growth and effective cost control. The bank's revenue reached $46 billion, surpassing the consensus of $44.14 billion, with significant contributions from the Equity Markets and IB fees. Despite macroeconomic challenges, JPMorgan's robust capital base, increased dividend, and stock buybacks support its valuation, making it an attractive investment. I'm OK with paying the premium because JPM deserves it, but its stock price can keep soaring thanks to the continuing expansion in tangible book value. I reiterate my """"Buy"""" rating on JPM stock due to its operational strength, fair valuation, and potential for continued market cap expansion."
4774856,2025-04-13,JPMorgan Chase: Banking Environment Becoming More Challenging,"The political situation and tariff strategy reversal have created significant uncertainty, overshadowing JPMorgan Chase's excellent first quarter results. Despite the turbulence, JPMorgan Chase maintains strong liquidity with a CET1 ratio of 15.4% and $1.5 trillion in cash and marketable securities. The banking industry fears deleveraging threats. Investors face a tough decision: Hold through volatility due to JPMorgan's strong management, or move to safer investments amid political and economic uncertainty. JPMorgan Chase has one of the best managements in any business to navigate the current period of turbulence."
4774907,2025-04-14,Is JPMorgan A 'Buy' Following Its Q1 2025 Earnings?,"JPMorgan is a high-quality bank with strong fundamentals, superior profitability, and a solid business profile, giving it a competitive edge over peers. Despite strong performance, JPMorgan's valuation remains high, trading at a premium compared to peers, and recent market volatility adds uncertainty to its outlook. Q1 2025 results showed revenue growth driven by non-interest revenue, but net interest income faced headwinds due to recent Fed rate cuts. Investors should wait for a larger pullback before buying JPMorgan shares, as the current risk-reward profile is still biased to the downside."
4775416,2025-04-15,JPMorgan: A Strong Case In An Uncertain Setting,"JPMorgan's Q1 2025 results show strong performance with a 9% YoY net income increase, despite rising credit costs and macroeconomic headwinds. The bank's diversified exposure and robust CET1 ratio position it well, but valuation concerns and uncertain growth outlook limit short-term upside. JPM's premium valuation, trading above its 5-year averages, makes it a Hold rather than a Buy, especially in uncertain economic times. Existing investors should Hold, while fresh investments can wait; consider Cash Secured Calls for income generation if owning the stock."
4776087,2025-04-17,JPMorgan: Well-Positioned To Withstand Any 'Kerfuffle',"JPM had a strong Q1, beating top- and bottom-line estimates, with significant growth in Consumer & Community Banking and double-digit growth in Corporate & Investment Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, JPM reaffirmed its 2025 guidance, showcasing resilience and a well-rounded business model, making it a solid investment during turbulent times. The stock's recent selloff has made it attractive, leading to an upgrade from HOLD to BUY, with a price target of $271, representing an 18% upside. Key risks include an earlier-than-expected recession and prolonged subdued M&A environment, which could negatively impact JPM's bottom line."
4779670,2025-04-30,Preferred Stocks To Sell (Part 1): JPMorgan's JPM.PR.C,"The US tariffs and recession fears triggered equity selling and weakened long-term treasuries, affecting debt issues and perpetual preferred stocks. JPMorgan Chase & Co. remains financially robust, with strong ratings and a stable outlook, but its preferred stock JPM-C is overvalued. JPM-C offers no upside potential compared to other JPM preferred stocks and peers with similar credit ratings, making it an unattractive investment. Investors should consider switching from JPM-C to higher-rated preferred stocks trading below par with better yields and appreciation potential."
4781716,2025-05-05,A Pair Trade Opportunity By JPMorgan's Preferred Stocks,"Market volatility due to US tariffs and recession fears has created an opportunity for pair trades in JPMorgan's preferred stocks, specifically JPM-L and JPM-D. JPMorgan's financials show concerning cash flow from operations, with a significant negative value reported for Q1 2025, raising sustainability questions. The pair trade between JPM-L and JPM-D offers a potential 6% profit due to the temporary equalization of their call option prices. Investors should use discretion to exploit this opportunity, considering the carry costs and liquidity of these preferred stocks."
