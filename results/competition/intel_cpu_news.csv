4232321,2019-01-09,Intel Hiring Practices Offers A Glimpse At Stock Price Direction,"Intel’s stock price can be correlated to its job openings. The stock price increases or decreases in sync with hiring activity. Intel has outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average after an increase in hiring activity. Intel has underperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average after a decrease in hiring activity. During the fourth quarter of 2018, hiring activity increased and would portend an improved stock performance in the first quarter of 2019."
4236312,2019-01-29,Intel: Buy For Solid Financials Despite A Bumpy Year Ahead,"Intel reported Q4 financial results, beating on EPS but missing on revenue. The stock plummeted 5% the next trading day on cautious guidance. Although the revenue miss is a negative event for INTC, the actual numbers are not as bad as they appear. Revenue increased 9.4%, while EPS grew 18% in the quarter. Intel's performance demonstrates strong financial efficiency standards during difficult times, which is the primary reason to own the stock at the moment. Although the competition continues to be stiff, Intel stock provides a solid margin of safety, with almost 3% dividend yield, 10 forward P/E, and impressive revenue and EPS growth."
4237083,2019-01-31,Intel: Any Epyc Impact?,"Ryzen and Epyc chips have been out for some time, and even newer versions have been released. AMD is doing nicely, but not crushing Intel. Intel put in another good quarter in a great year. At the current market price, based on the latest dividend increase, dividend growth investors might want to wait for a price drop."
4245672,2019-03-01,Intel Has A Marvelous Tailwind From Foveros,"The new products unveiled at MWC 2019 Barcelona event justified why I remained long INTC. Intel’s Foveros 3D Stacking technology-enabled 10-nanometer Lakefield System-on-Chip has fabulous long-term commercial potential. The proprietary Foveros chip design IP is a marvelous tailwind for Intel's $60 billion/year desktop & server semiconductor business. The hybrid x86 3D stacking semiconductor design will persuade Apple to keep using Intel processors for its Mac computer products. 3D stacked processors has future applications in smart devices, robotics, and self-driving cars."
4247790,2019-03-11,Intel Vs. AMD: Battle For Market Share,"2018 was a great year for both Intel and AMD, particularly in the CPU market. AMD's top-line increased 23% as they gained market share from Intel, while Intel themselves managed a 13% revenue increase by inflating their CPU prices on the market. My forecast of the CPU market share between these two rivals for the next 4 years indicates their monopoly of the market may be ending. I identified a significant threat to the traditional x86 CPU market in the rise of ARM-based processors which are rapidly creeping into the market."
4253415,2019-04-08,Intel Helps Drive Data Center Advancements,"It's clear Intel is now thinking about more comprehensive sets of solutions for data centers, CSPs, and other institutions with high-performance computing demands. It's a bit surprising it took the company as long as it did to start telling these more all-encompassing stories, but there's little doubt it will be a key focus over the next several years. CPUs will continue to be important, but the reinvention of computing, memory, and storage architectures will yield some of the most interesting developments to come."
4255394,2019-04-18,Intel: Positive Financials By Withdrawing From The 5G Smartphone Market,"Intel's April 16, 2019, announcement that it would exit the 5G smartphone modem market was favorably received by the market. Because Intel management saw no clear path to profitability and positive returns with $40 5G smartphone modems, the company has instead emphasized production of $700 server CPUs. This strategy is an about-face to the company's decision in 2008 to emphasize $29 Atom chips for netbooks instead of $279 desktop Penryn CPUs. Yet, the withdrawal of one of the core next-generation technologies seems counterintuitive in the face of Intel's sluggish PC-centric segment. This article highlights the positive financial impact of the company's decision."
4257738,2019-04-29,Intel Earnings Are Not What They Seem To Be,"Intel beat Q1, but gave a soft Q2 guidance and took down FY guidance. That seems a bit odd, doesn't it? We explain the incongruence. Intel's data center weakness is real, but what the company is not telling investors is the impact AMD's products are having on its market share. Due to competitive dynamics, we predict ongoing Intel under-performance."
4265427,2019-05-20,Intel: Really Attractive After Recent 25% Sell-Off,"Intel shares are down 25% from their 52-week high. A combination of disappointing earnings and China fears has put pressure on the stock. However, the company's tremendous performance during 2016, 2017, and 2018, combined with this weakness, has resulted in a low 10x P/E ratio. Intel pays a safe 2.8% yield as well, making it attractive to me as a dividend growth investor looking for technology exposure."
4269237,2019-06-08,Intel Is Worth More Than 10x Forward PE,"Compared with AMD and Nvidia, Intel's recent share price has been beaten down disproportionately by the same macro picture and industry-specific factors. Apparently, the market has priced in Intel’s inability to launch its 10nm chips in time to defend its CPU market share from AMD’s EPYC and 7nm products. Despite of all the negatives, using a revenue perspective, Intel’s fair value should be between $57 and $62. Intel is still undervalued by 25%-35%. Using an earnings perspective, Intel’s fair value should be between $46 and $50. Intel is undervalued by 5%-10%. The fact that the current market has priced Intel’s stock more towards its profitability than revenue points out an alarming possibility that Intel may lose more significant market share to AMD."
4290945,2019-09-11,Why Intel Could Be The Perfect Tech Recession Stock,"Intel provides a great combination of value, momentum and financial strength.
         Its performance during the last quarter of 2018 suggests it could perform a lot better than the overall market during a recession.
         While the current combination of dividend yield and dividend growth isn't satisfactory for dividend investors, shareholders should strongly consider holding on to this tech position."
4291929,2019-09-16,Intel: Don't Chase This Yield,"Intel has rallied back to the low $50s, where the dividend yield loses appeal. The company is struggling with market share losses to AMD and a CPU processor business that has already pulled forward sales. The stock trades at 12x forward EPS estimates with no growth forecasted. The dividend yield loses all appeal below the current 2.4% rate."
4292079,2019-09-17,Intel Vs. AMD: Losing The Battle But Winning The War,"Due to its sheer size, Intel stock price is historically more sensitive to revenue growth than to market share. Intel has a good chance to win the CPU war if 3Q revenue is ready to ramp from a renewed corporate IT budget and the scheduled 10nm launch. In contrast, due to its small market share, AMD’s stock price is more sensitive to market share changes than to revenue growth. AMD’s relative valuation will increase as it will win the battle of market share increase against Intel from its 7nm new product offerings. Relative to AMD, Intel is considerably undervalued, given the expected market share and revenue growth."
4293912,2019-09-27,Computing Power: Beyond The Size Of Processors,"The ever-increasing levels of data usage are likely to require increasing levels of processing capacity. While Moore’s law may be coming to an end, the alternatives to conventional computing are likely to ensure that the growth in processing power continues unabated. The evolution of intelligence in the software also promises to utilize commodity (relatively speaking) processors to deliver extreme performance."
4295395,2019-10-07,Why We Remain Long Intel,"We went long INTC when it was trading below $25. We added some more when it traded below $45. Intel’s supremacy on x86 processors is why we still remain long INTC. We are not worried over the hype on AMD’s Ryzen and EPYC. In spite of AMD’s more affordable Ryzen processors, Intel remains the go-to processor supplier for most PC manufacturers. A healthy balance sheet and highly profitable data center business convinced us Intel can win a pricing war against Advanced Micro Devices."
4297960,2019-10-22,AMD's Extremely Successful Price Strategy Could Burden AMD And Intel Investors Long Term,"The launch of the second Epyc CPU generation, powered by AMD's latest ZEN 2 core design, was not so long ago. At the moment, AMD is promoting the price/performance ratio of this Epyc generation. Given that, there is an extremely impressive defeat for Intel. Investors need to look at AMD's operations without bias and ask themselves whether management is really getting every possible USD of profit out of the company. In my opinion, AMD should put the focus a little more away from the penetration strategy, and instead, switch a little more to the skimming strategy."
4298895,2019-10-24,AMD's EPYC Blows Intel's Xeon Out Of The Water,"AMD has released EPYC Rome, its new line of server CPUs. It's apparent that Intel's current lineup of Xeon chips is overmatched. With advantages in price and performance, AMD is already gaining market share at Intel's expense."
4303143,2019-11-06,Intel: 2 Reasons For Optimism,Intel reported third quarter results recently that produced record growth for its data-centric businesses. The company also announced it was adding an additional $20 billion to its share repurchase authorization. Intel has been paying a dividend longer than several other large cap tech names. Strong performance from the Data Center Group and shareholders returns should make Intel a very appealing stock to investors.
4310433,2019-12-04,Intel Vs. Advanced Micro Devices: Not A Zero-Sum CPU Game,"Since 2017, Intel has lost 10% PC CPU market share and 5% server market share to AMD. The current analysts’ estimate suggests that Intel may lose another 2% CPU market share to AMD in the next 2-3 years. Market share gain is more important to AMD than to Intel as AMD has a much smaller market share than Intel to start with. AMD’s shares are currently trading at a premium relative to Intel shares, reflecting AMD’s forthcoming CPU market share gain. Despite a projected 2% market share loss to AMD, Intel shares will still gain from the annual 5% growth of the CPU space."
4311877,2019-12-11,Intel: Here Come The Custom Chips,"Whether Amazon’s Graviton2 will be the game changer for the CPU market remains to be seen, Intel has to be sensitive to the emerging trend of customers’ designing proprietary chips. Intel’s large cloud customer Amazon’s Graviton2 stands to take away $120 million immediate revenue from Intel. Google’s TPUs may take $650 million, and Microsoft’s FPGAs may take $700 million. The wide uses of custom chips are restricted by their customized nature. Intel has about 2% revenue exposure on the custom chips from the 3 cloud providers. Merchants developing their own proprietary silicon, i.e., Apple, should be a more alarming trend. Currently, Intel has about 4%, or $2.5 billion annual revenue exposure potentially to Apple’s SoC/SiP chips."
4316811,2020-01-15,Intel: All Eyes On Q4,"Intel will be reporting its Q4 earnings in two weeks, on January 23. Investors should closely monitor its ASP and shipment growth, its segment-level performance and listen in on its management's commentary about supply shortages. Tracking these items will help us in understanding how real is the AMD threat for Intel."
4321210,2020-02-04,Intel: Bob Swan One Year CEO Scorecard,
4321159,2020-02-04,Nvidia Faces Huge Threat From Intel's Chiplet GPU Approach,"Despite being a new entrant to discrete GPUs, Intel is innovating its way into the market. Intel’s chiplet approach to GPUs brings all the (same) benefits as AMD’s Epyc Rome: process advantage, higher yield, cheaper cost, higher performance, lower power and earlier time to market. Intel's multi-GPU approach might give Intel an edge in mobile. Nvidia trades at a premium in the market, but the company's competitive environment will escalate from manageable to severe. Market share erosion could follow. With increased competition, dwindled and unclear growth aspects, and a high valuation, Nvidia doesn't offer a clear investment proposition. The 'Tesla factor' aside."
4322225,2020-02-06,Stock Buybacks Are Covering Up Intel's Operating Performance Deterioration,A review of Intel 10-k shows that the Company's operational performance is slipping. EPS growth is being driven by cost reductions and stock buybacks. We discuss the quality of earnings and the challenges Intel faces.
4325780,2020-02-20,"Intel's Adjacencies Now Larger Than Nvidia, Undervalued","Intel’s adjacency businesses have become larger in size and are growing faster than Nvidia, a $150 billion company in market cap. Intel also has a >$20 billion and growing data center business and a >$35 billion highly profitable PC business (for just $130 billion """"additional"""" market cap, at 2.4x P/S). Hence, the market is undervaluing the company's core business, its adjacency segments, or both. If they continue their historic double-digit growth rates, they will contribute $10 billion to Intel's revenue growth in the next four to five years."
4326611,2020-02-24,Next-Gen 3D XPoint: A Glimpse Into The Future Of Memory,"A Micron patent application reveals the ace up their sleeve. Next-gen 3D XPoint will narrow the performance gap with DRAM. Unlike the captive Intel model, Micron is targeting an open fabric model."
4326757,2020-02-25,Alpha Trader Talks 'New Paradigm' Tech With Mark Hibben (Podcast),"This week's Alpha Trader features hosts Aaron Task and Stephen Alpher talking tech with Mark Hibben of Rethink Technology. Also up for discussion are the continuing coronavirus developments. A sizable economic slowdown now seems assured, and that's brought the potential for another round of rate cuts back into play. While the market averages may have brushed off much of the cornoavirus concern, Task notes about half the stocks in the Nasdaq are in bear markets - that is off 20% or more from 52-week highs. So take away the MAGA names and high-flyers like Tesla and Virgin Galactic, and it's already pretty ugly out there. Hibben isn't scared away by the gaudy one-year returns for a lot of the tech names he holds. He reminds that the big gains follow the major losses seen in the last few months of 2018. Still, Hibben acknowledges valuations are getting a little perky at these levels, and he's not finding a lot to buy right now. What Hibben calls new paradigm semiconductor companies (mostly Apple, but names like Samsung and Huawei also fit) are those that design most of the processors put into their products. At first derided as a Steve Jobs folly, Hibben argues that the shift has been perhaps the major reason for the massive profits at Apple over the last decade."
4327723,2020-02-27,Intel Drops A Bomb On The 5G Network,"Intel has announced a complete portfolio of 5G network infrastructure silicon: Snow Ridge Atom 24-core SoC for base station, next-gen eASIC device and 5G-optimized Ethernet adapter. Intel has pulled in its goal to become #1 silicon provider for base stations by a year to 2021 (40% market share) with design wins with Nokia, ZTE and Ericsson. Networking will become a $25 billion market by 2023, and was a $5 billion business for Intel in 2019. Intel's revenue will accelerate driven by 5G adoption. Refreshed Cascade Lake lineup significantly improves performance per dollar."
4335290,2020-03-31,"Intel: Work-From-Home Means People Need PCs And Data Centers, Banner Year Ahead","As the world moves to work from home, many internet-related companies are profiting. To work from home means people need PCs. Intel sells PC chips and powers the underlying data centers. Demand for both looks to be surging. I (hence) expect Intel to reach its 2021 revenue target this year. In uncertain economic times, companies may also be less inclined to switch to AMD's Ryzen and Epyc. Intel suspends buybacks. Apple might delay 5G iPhone."
4353773,2020-06-15,The True Blue-Chip Maker: Intel,"Intel's strong profit margins, liquid balance sheet, rising dividend story, and above-average business prospects are underappreciated by Wall Street. Robust IoT, cloud and AI related demand will support processor and semiconductor growth rates for years to come. Clear investor accumulation evidence and upside momentum trends support a bullish argument."
4355217,2020-06-23,It's Time To Short Intel: I Can't Watch The Bubble Any Longer,"Apple's Silicon announcement is significant because not only does it mean lost revenue but it highlights a trend. The company's data center and desktop CPUs are losing, even from an x86 standpoint, to AMD. The company has some exciting businesses, however, they don't justify the company's valuation."
4356860,2020-07-03,Intel Drops A Bomb On The Silicon AI Market,"Early this year, I detailed that Intel would lead the """"AI revolution"""". Recently, the company has launched a portfolio of products that enhance its position in AI. Cooper Lake strengthens Intel’s AI leadership in CPUs. Its successor, Sapphire Rapids, is on track for 2021 and features next-gen DLBoost. Stratix 10 NX with """"AI Tensor Blocks"""" announced: 15x AI performance vs. prior Stratix 10 FPGAs. Intel remains on track to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI silicon."
4359501,2020-07-20,Intel: Low Bar To Crush Earnings,"PC sales were estimated to jump between 2 to 11% YoY in Q2. IDC and Gartner noted recovery after supposed Q1 supply chain disruptions. Intel had nonetheless (already) delivered a blowout Q1, so Q2 might be even better. If the cloud surged as much as the average SaaS stock this quarter, Intel should deliver an even greater beat. Tiger Lake will make Intel reclaim CPU leadership (in laptops), while Mobileye continues solid ADAS and AV progress. Second-half guidance could be relevant, as Intel withdrew full-year guidance in April."
4364711,2020-08-05,Intel: The Nanometer Games,"Intel reported 20% YoY revenue growth. Intel is a healthy company satisfying the ever-growing compute demand. Intel shares plunged after delaying 7nm by 6-12 months. Let’s not lose perspective: Analysts are not electrical engineers, neither does Intel sell nanometers; it sells products. While a hiccup, it does not take away from Intel's financial growth opportunities. Not all nanometers are created equal, and neither is a nanometer a predictor for product or financial performance."
4364603,2020-08-05,"Intel Places Multi-Billion-Dollar Wafer Order At TSMC, Murthy Gone","On the verge of Intel's 7nm delay, rumors have surfaced of a multi-dollar order at TSMC for 6N wafers and 5N for Ponte Vecchio. This confirms Intel's plans to expand outsourcing. Intel purportedly also considering leveraging 5N and 3N for CPUs. Intel might move to 3N ahead of AMD. Intel reorganizes manufacturing as Murthy gets the boot (following the 7nm issues)."
4367834,2020-08-11,Intel Tiger Lake Will Likely Crush AMD,"In a previous article, I suggested that Intel was likely to crush earnings. Intel delivered. Of course, since market share evolves slowly, this might not be fully representative of the current product competitive environment. In the past quarter, many have voiced that AMD currently has CPU leadership, a sentiment further ‘proved’ by Apple’s switch away from Intel silicon. However, Intel’s upcoming Tiger Lake will likely crush AMD in single-thread performance while being competitive in multi-thread, despite having half the number of cores. AMD’s purported ‘leadership’ is merely one of appearance: its products simply contain ‘more’ cores, not ‘better’ cores. AMD does not have a moat."
4369707,2020-08-19,Intel: Price Correction An Overreaction,"In its earnings briefing, Intel highlighted issues with its process technology resulting in delays for next generation processors. Its stock price has dropped by 20% since the announcement, which we determined as a huge overreaction by the market. The current market price reflects a 48% decline in CCG revenues, while our calculations indicate a mere 7.8% decline even after taking account of potential future losses in CPUs. We applied a sum of the parts valuation approach to determine the group’s fair value, accounting for the delay as well as the Intel's non-CPU segments."
4372661,2020-09-04,Intel: A Market Leader At A Great Price,"Intel stock's steep price drop due to the 7nm delay is an opportunity to buy. Intel has leading market share in personal computers and servers, a moat that is very likely to be strengthened by the new tiger lake architecture processors. AMD maybe closing in on the desktop processor market, but decline of desktop sales began 10 years ago. Unparalleled R&D spend positions Intel well to achieve early entry into new markets. Trading under 10 PE, Intel offers a great entry point for long term investors."
4374889,2020-09-17,Intel: Tiger Lake Adds To The Bull Case,"Lots of positive takeaways from Intel's Tiger Lake launch, particularly on the performance front. The rebranding exercise across Project Athena (now Intel Evo) and for the overall company signals intent. Potential outsourcing of its advanced products to TSMC likely mitigates future production delays. ~$10bn accelerated buyback signals belief in its near and long-term prospects, and adds to downside protection. Risk/reward appears highly favorable at these levels."
4376732,2020-09-28,Nvidia Vs. Intel: The Semi Battle Of The Decade,"Intel and Nvidia are on a collision course. Competition between both semiconductor giants will intensify. This could lead to headwinds for both. Nvidia is on track to acquire Arm for $40 billion, getting access to the world’s most widely used architecture and top-class CPU design teams. Arm is also trying to gain a foothold in (Intel's) data center, where Nvidia has also increased its efforts with Mellanox and GPUs for AI. Intel, meanwhile, is developing a leading top-to-bottom GPU software and hardware stack, targeting all the same verticals as Nvidia. The stakes are very high for both. Intel's biggest risk is its much higher revenue base, while Nvidia has a much steeper market valuation to lose."
4377146,2020-10-01,"For Years, Intel Sat On Its CPU Monopoly And Now The Tide Turns Against Them","Intel lost its drive to outperform. Intel's Blueprint was more about AMD and their competitors than about their new CPU. 11th gen Tigerlake is a good product, but who is Intel addressing with their new CPU? Intel's lack of technological progress shows clearly in their multi-core performance even against AMD's older-gen CPUs."
4382570,2020-10-29,Intel Is Getting Squeezed - The Contrarian Case,"Intel has a long history of underperformance. AMD's and Nvidia's acquisitions will add more pressure to the company. But, Intel is cheap, has a few catalysts, and has a safe dividend."
4384523,2020-11-03,Intel Q3: Very Bullish 7nm News,"In the first half, COVID-19 was a tailwind for Intel. In Q3, it turned into a headwind. This caused the 'horrible' quarter that was 'merely' in line with guidance. The reason Intel did not beat can entirely be ascribed to weak results in non-core businesses, such as the 3D NAND unit which Intel is selling. Intel's results also have nothing to do with AMD. Intel's growth drivers, cloud and comms, will be up strong in the double digits in full 2020. Bob Swan is very bullish on 7nm, and said the defect is """"fixed"""". Intel will make outsourcing decision in early 2021."
4391512,2020-11-25,Intel Deepens In Value,"Intel remains in a quagmire due to design defects preceding innovation to their 7nm processor. Intel's competitors are not so hamstrung and instead are making big moves to grow. Intel's accelerated repurchase plan appears to have been a major dud. Intel is likely to do more accelerated repurchasing, because that is management's core competency, as opposed to innovating themselves out of their 7nm quagmire."
4396305,2020-12-27,Intel: Another One Bites The Dust,"Intel has experienced significant difficulties in recent years as the company has been hindered by slow innovation, rising competition, and negative market externalities. Intel's slow pace of innovation leaves the company especially vulnerable to increased adoption of ARM processors in the server and the personal computer space. At the present moment, Intel faces considerable long-term challenges."
4399259,2021-01-15,Time For Intel To Admit Defeat,"This week, with CES 2021 (the tech conference) underway, Intel has announced a couple of important updates regarding its future in the CPU industry. While one update regards a chip that looks to (finally) be competitive, it is unlikely to be enough to help Intel regain its lead in the industry. The second update is a bit more surprising, implying either that Intel is no longer leveraging its fab advantage or that it is attempting to directly undermine AMD. Overall, Intel is looking increasingly weak and slow despite holding several industry advantages (e.g., size and fabs)."
4400987,2021-01-26,Intel And The Innovator's Dilemma,"Intel is smack dab in the middle of the Innovator’s Dilemma. Many are focused on their foundry problems, but the bigger long term issue are ARM chips that are getting better performance at much lower power draw than Intel’s x86 platform. New management does not have much time, and they must pivot soon."
4402616,2021-02-02,Intel: Tune Out All The Noise,Intel is facing tough challenges despite just having posted its 5th straight earnings record. The tone during the earnings call on the 7nm process has improved substantially and grown more confident. Intel is unlikely to outsource its core CPU chip production to TSMC but it could do so for other products like GPUs. Intel's cash reserves and cash flow generation dwarf that of main rival AMD and Intel has abundant financial firepower to catch up with TSMC. I am tuning out the noise and instead eagerly awaiting the unveiling of Intel's 2023 roadmap by its CEO-elect Pat Gelsinger.
4414511,2021-03-17,Intel Rocket Lake: The Innovator's Dilemma,"Intel's latest desktop CPU, Rocket Lake, has been widely panned by reviewers. The article discusses the reasons. The article also discusses the mindset at Intel that brought this suboptimal CPU into existence. Intel needs to snap out of its current IDM mindset or the Company's greatness will slip away over time."
4415857,2021-03-25,Intel: Be Greedy When Others Are Fearful,"Intel is a very solid company that has a better growth track record than most give it credit for. The company's underlying performance has been very reliable over the last five years, and the company hit new record results in 2020. Share prices and underlying results do sometimes not seem tied too closely, which allows investors to exploit irrational market movements. Buy when shares are a bargain due to the market's (oftentimes excessive) worries."
4418385,2021-04-09,Ice Lake-SP Tells A Cautionary Tale For Intel Investors,"On the verge of its Unleashed event with historic Intel Foundry Services announcement, Intel's latest event featured the launch of its Ice Lake-SP server CPUs. Ice Lake-SP has been delayed by at least 1-2 years and continues to trail behind the competition significantly. This CPU embodies everything of the failed Intel in recent years. In 2019, Intel touted Aurora as the first 2021 exascale supercomputer. However, the 7nm GPU was already delayed, and the 10nm Sapphire Rapids CPU is also delayed into 2022. The Unleashed event was about the future, but the Ice Lake launch represents the present. Intel is not yet back."
4418726,2021-04-12,Intel: Time For The Bears To Bail,"Given the highly variable quarter-to-quarter CPU spending by cloud providers, it makes little sense to judge Intel on quarterly performance. In 2020, Intel delivered its fifth consecutive record year despite lagging competitiveness in key areas. This confirms my investment thesis that the overall market is growing more than Intel is losing market share. Intel in fact gained market share in Q4. With a slew of heavily improved products on the horizon, and 7nm fixed, it is (finally) time for the bears to bail."
4419076,2021-04-14,Intel: Nvidia CPU Scare Is Smoke And Mirrors,"Intel sold off significantly recently due to news of Nvidia entering the (data center) CPU business. I consider the sell-off a short-term overreaction for multiple reasons. Primarily, the CPU won’t launch for two more years, and Nvidia itself said it is targeted at niche applications. Moreover, Nvidia’s inroad in CPUs should actually indicate to investors that Nvidia is playing catch-up to the leader in AI on CPUs, which is Intel. Previous sell-offs have turned out to be overreactions: Apple Silicon, 7nm delay, Microsoft chip rumor, etc."
4419014,2021-04-14,Intel: Supply Chain Crunch Dampens 2021 Outlook,Intel's supply chain is affected by the shortage of critical manufacturing components for CPUs which management had to acknowledge with a 2021 guidance of a contraction of 7.5%. The company is aiming for a turnaround after lagging in process technology and losing market share to AMD which has its strongest product portfolio. Intel is expanding its capacity with a committed investment of $20 bln and capex growth of 33% this year as it aims its sights on TSMC and Samsung in the foundry market. The sale of its NAND business is welcomed as part of its strategy to focus on capacity expansion and R&D to close the technology gap between competitors.
4421481,2021-04-27,Intel: The Truth Is In Between,Intel has lagged the market for several quarters. Operating performance has been mixed. The market has focused on the negative. The post-earnings pullback provides a buying opportunity.
4422013,2021-04-28,Intel Stock: Is Its Valuation Fair?,"We believe Intel to be a fundamentally attractive stock, as long as purchased within the lower part of its recent trading range. We don't believe the stock performance is much related to product performance vs. competitors nor its rate of innovation vs. newer players. We see the move to a fabrication services model as commercially illogical but politically important as the great power blocs of the world gear up in semiconductor IP and manufacturing. We lay out our logic below together with where we see the buy and sell limits in the trading range."
4434860,2021-06-15,Intel: Game-Changing Alder Lake CPU,
4447054,2021-08-09,Intel: The Game Is On AMD,"Intel's 11th Gen Laptop CPUs made the biggest generational jump for Intel mobile CPUs in a while. Intel is renaming its nodes and thus leveling the 'naming' playing field in the foundry business but it doesn't change the fundamentals. TSMC becomes a supplier for Intel's next-gen 5nm and 3nm chips. This could be an important strategic step for Intel to leapfrog a generation. If AMD remains on this trajectory, Intel will experience deteriorating margins."

4450600,2021-08-19,Intel Lays Out Multi-Chip Architecture Plans,"Fresh off an impressive discussion of its long-term chip manufacturing process road map at its Intel Accelerated event, and the debut of its new Intel Arc brand for discrete GPUs aimed at gamers, the company provided an equally impressive and comprehensive view of the designs that will be powering these and other future chips at its latest Architecture Day 2021. It’s clear that Intel is serious about not only retaking its crown in the world of high-performance CPUs, but it also wants to make its mark in GPUs, IPUs, ASICs and multiple different types of chips. In addition, the company is making a strategically critical pivot towards integrating smaller, individual elements together to achieve that success. To put it succinctly, it’s planning to use multiple tile-based designs across multiple types of chips."
4455215,2021-09-14,Intel: Still Facing Near-Term Competitive Challenges,"Since our previous analysis, Intel has provided updates on its technology roadmap with rebranded process nodes and more insight into its plans to revitalize its performance. Though, its market share across CCG and DCG continues to decline against AMD’s popular Ryzen and EPYC chips which guide our forecast for it to decline by mid-single digits. Longer-term growth drivers in AV and IoT could provide some relief to Intel with our forecast accelerating to 22% by 2025 but only accounting for 17% of revenues. We obtained a downside of -5.6% despite the low valuation multiples with an EV/EBITDA of 6.5x due to the poor near-term growth outlook of the company."
4456933,2021-09-24,Intel: Catalysts From Windows 11 And Windows 365,"INTC’s price return since my August 19 buy recommendation is already +3.59%. I am again endorsing INTC as a buy. It is final, Microsoft demands TPM 2.0 for Windows 11. This could help Intel improve its forward revenue CAGR of 0.59%. BIOS updates cannot transform TPM 1.2 chips in to TPM 2.0 hardware. Windows 365 and Office 365 are most likely powered by Intel Xeon server processors."
4462483,2021-10-27,Intel Highlights Benefits Of Software-Optimized Silicon,"From cloud-based chip emulation kits to AI framework enhancements to new tools for creating applications that function across network connections, we appear to be embarking on a new era of silicon-focused software optimizations being created by chip makers themselves. At Intel’s first Intel On event, the company highlighted this development through a series of announcements - including the launch of an updated Developer Zone website - which re-emphasized Intel’s desire to put developers of all types and levels at the forefront of its efforts. Intel’s focus on its oneAPI platform highlights the increasingly essential role that software tools play in getting the most from today’s silicon advancements. Giventhe increasing sophistication of chips like CPUs and GPUs, it’s easy to see whynew developer tools are necessary to not only more fully leverage theseindividual components but also to take advantage of the capabilities madepossible by combinations of these chips."
4463376,2021-11-01,Intel: Unquestioned PC Leadership,"Early this year, I predicted that Intel's upcoming Alder Lake CPU would be game-changing and achieve leadership in all segments against AMD. New benchmarks of Alder Lake for laptops confirm that the CPU even beats Apple M1 Max in both single and multi-threaded performance. AMD is far behind. This means that Intel for the first time in years has achieved unquestioned leadership with a CPU. The AMD threat is finished."
4464383,2021-11-02,Intel Will Be The Top Semiconductor Stock Through 2025,"Intel invests more in research and development than its top four peers combined, setting the stage for disruptive innovation and outperformance. The company is now leveraging its R&D with an aggressive growth strategy christened by a $20 billion investment in two state-of-the-art semiconductor foundries in Arizona. Intel’s fastest growing opportunities are on the innovation frontier including AI, 5G network transformation, and the intelligent and autonomous edge. In autonomous driving, Intel’s Mobileye platform continues to secure design wins at major US and global automakers with 25 OEMs and 49 production platforms. Intel’s low valuation provides the opportunity for a highly-skewed return profile to the upside offering an asymmetric risk/reward tradeoff."
4466252,2021-11-05,Nvidia Vs. Intel: Zettascale Is The New Metaverse,"Nvidia and Intel remain on their collision course as became apparent in the last few years (respectively launching a CPU and GPU). However, investors in both stocks remain concerned about very different topics. For one, Facebook and Nvidia are currently propping up their stocks with gimmicks such as the “metaverse”. Meanwhile, Intel seems to be working on revolutionary new technology since it has set the target to achieve zettascale performance by 2027. This is 10 years ahead of Moore’s Law. Investors will quickly forget their metaverse dreams if Nvidia falls so far behind in technology. This means the downside for investors could be astronomical, especially given how overvalued the stock is."
4467278,2021-11-09,Intel Stock: Disregard The Message And Messenger,"Intel guidance for Q4 2021 blamed the semiconductor shortage, but I am dismissing those articles as an excuse with no validation. While Alder Lake will help Intel in the Desktop PC market, its CPU shipments were just 18.6 million Desktop CPUs versus 49.3 million Notebook CPUs in the latest quarter. Historic problems and delays with chip production at 10nm will only amplify against TSMC and Samsung foundry powerhouses at 3nm."
4467917,2021-11-10,Intel's Rise To Market Leadership Is Likely,"Investing in Intel was not the right decision for past years; however, I believe times are changing. Intel has strong government support for its fabrication business, and the company is laying out ambitious timeline with its visionary CEO. Intel proved that it is capable of achieving its goals with the successful release of the Alder Lake CPU. I believe Intel provides investors with value, dividends, and growth opportunities."
4469981,2021-11-16,Intel Stock Forecast: What's The Outlook As Market Share Is Lost To AMD?,"Intel has been losing market share to AMD in the PC processor and server processor market. AMD's recent win in the data center processor market with Meta Platforms could point to further market share loss for INTC in this segment. INTC's consensus earnings forecasts have been slashed significantly in recent months, and the company is not expected to witness a substantial earnings recovery until 2024 at the earliest."
4473345,2021-12-03,AMD Vs. Intel: Battle For FPGA Leadership,"Given AMD's Xilinx acquisition, questions arise about who will hold FPGA leadership going forward. Intel Agilex FPGA achieves 30-50% higher performance and 2x performance per watt than Xilinx Versal. Intel further leads in innovation due to leadership transceivers, chiplet and 3D packaging, and AI performance. This means there is one clear winner. Intel is the unquestioned leader in FPGAs. Xilinx-AMD could be in trouble."
4476675,2021-12-23,AMD Vs. Intel: I Was Wrong About AMD,"I recently considered AMD’s server roadmap to be too weak. However, I made the mistake of only using Intel rumors and not AMD rumors. AMD’s 256-core Turin (Zen 5) could spoil Pat Gelsinger’s """"unquestioned leadership"""" plans. Hence, I reverse to neutral on Intel: let Intel ship their chips first. In the long term, AMD’s success is dependent on TSMC. Conversely, process leadership is a requirement for Intel to be able to overtake AMD. Intel has a solid PC roadmap, but until it regains process leadership (in 2025+) and shows proof of being a """"data center-first"""" company, Intel might at best trade sideways."
4477041,2021-12-28,Intel Focuses On Unlocking Massive Shareholder Value,"Intel has announced the spin-off of Mobileye at a valuation equivalent to 25% of the company's market capitalization. The company is also focusing on releasing top of the line CPUs, which are competitive with AMD, and launching its new discrete GPU with TSMC. The company expects to maintain and grow existing revenue and cash flow, with an already low multiple. Additionally, the company expects to pass TSMC and Samsung on process miniaturization going into 2025, helping long-term returns."
4477621,2022-01-02,Downgrading Intel,"After about two quarters into his """"dream job"""", CEO Pat Gelsinger already started to amass criticism for his inability to turn Intel around. Pat Gelsinger never claimed he could turn the ship in one year. From the beginning, he had maintained an outlook into 2024-2025. In the near term, Intel’s only focus is regaining technology leadership. Intel now is like AMD in 2013-14, three or four years before Zen even launched into the market. This does lead to the conclusion that Intel could trade sideways for several more years, especially since the new businesses (Habana, Xe, IFS, and Mobileye) have yet to gain scale. Downgrading the stock: let Intel launch a 20A chip first to prove they're really back, then the financial results may follow, and then the stock performance."
4479135,2022-01-12,Intel Stock Forecast: What To Watch For In 2022,"Intel's Alder Lake seems to be competitive on both desktop and mobile. It also shared that its mobile processors are now """"the world's fastest"""" at CES 2022. Nevertheless, Intel's ambitious foundry roadmap will continue to weigh on its EBIT and FCF profitability. NVIDIA and AMD also continue to consolidate their leadership in the GPU market with their entry-level discrete graphics. We discuss what investors should look out for in 2022."
4480425,2022-01-19,Intel's Future Depends On Its Competitors Failing,"I am re-evaluating a short position on Intel in light of many recent factors, including the stock's relative performance against AMD. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's recent earnings call just shows how far ahead TSM is and how far behind Intel remains. Intel has lagged behind its peers in this market, and its upcoming projects seem to be part of a """"shotgun"""" strategy, with no real focus."
4483376,2022-02-01,Intel: Cloud Collapse,"As expected, PC revenue declined slightly. However, contrary to anyone’s expectations, data center had a miraculous blockbuster record quarter. Intel has responded firmly to the AMD bulls. Nevertheless, digging deeper reveals appalling cloud performance, offset by 5G (and enterprise) saving the day. Cloud has posted its fifth consecutive double-digit decline. Ice Lake is ramping significantly slower than Skylake and Cascade Lake. Data center still has to rely mostly on 14nm into 2022, which explains the cloud collapse. R&D is now on a $16B run rate. Intel added a monstrous 11K employees (mostly engineers) in 2021 to rebuild the execution machine going forward."
4485895,2022-02-10,Is Intel Stock A Buy Or Sell After Recent Earnings?,"Intel's recent Q4 2021 earnings were ahead of the company's management guidance and the market consensus' sell-side estimates. But Intel's Q1 2022 management guidance was disappointing, which meant that the company's weak stock price performance post-results was justified. Intel stock remains a Hold after recent earnings, taking into account both its valuations and financial outlook."
4488742,2022-02-21,Intel: Pat Gelsinger's Potential Is Being Grossly Discounted,"Pat Gelsinger is aggressively pursuing the realization of IDM 2.0 and also attracting top talent to Intel. There is a lot to consider regarding Gelsinger’s leadership, IFS, packaging endeavors, and Intel’s role in the hardware ecosystem, before giving this investment opportunity a thumbs down. We think INTC will sustain their dominance in the laptop market whilst gaining momentum in high-end PC and server CPU markets."
4488935,2022-02-22,Intel: A Year Into The Gelsinger Plan,"Intel’s plan is to keep their x86 CPU business while at the same time adding TSM’s foundry business. Both parts of that are tall orders. Intel's foundry plan is super ambitious on a compressed timeline, and it’s not clear that help from their vendors and a two-track approach will be enough. The biggest threat to the plan out of their control is a crash in durables demand just as they are bringing all this new capacity on line. I still believe the most likely outcome is that the x86 business withers away, and the foundry remains in third place, but Pat Gelsinger has stood Intel’s culture on its head."
4498488,2022-03-29,Intel: Finally Time To Buy,"We determined AMD’s superior CPU performance over Intel by analyzing 232 products across 4 to 5 generations based on their average benchmark scores for each product generation. However, Intel's jump in its CPU performance in the recent year has made it more competitive than before, enabling it to better defend its market share. On top of that, we determined that Intel’s market share in the semiconductor market could be buoyed by its aggressive expansion plans as well as its new foundry services segment. We revised our growth projections for Intel upwards, deriving a strong buying opportunity for its shares."
4500813,2022-04-11,Intel And AMD: Both Poised To Cater Our Insatiable Chip Appetite,"As the two silicon titans, both Intel and AMD are good candidates to play the unstoppable secular trend of our digital future. And recent corrections provide entry opportunities for both. This article provides an in-depth comparison so you can pick the one that suits your risk profile and time frame. The year 2021 finished with AMD setting an all-time CPU market share record as Intel gains in desktop and notebook PCs. Intel’s acquisition of Tower Semiconductor accelerates its vertical integration with direct access to a wafer foundry."
4503251,2022-04-25,Intel: EUV Misinformation,"Speculation has run rampant about Intel purportedly being last in line to receive EUV tools and being unable to secure enough tools to ramp its EUV nodes. So, the bear thesis goes, even if Intel executes its leadership process roadmap flawlessly, Intel won’t be able to ship these nodes. In reality, there is no evidence Intel is last in line and ASML has aggressively ramped EUV production over the last few years (and will continue to ramp further). Even using extremely conservative estimates, Intel should be able to produce twice as many CPUs as Tiger Lake, which was Intel’s fastest ramping notebook CPU ever. I provide a bull case scenario where I would overnight quadruple my Intel stake."
4516741,2022-06-06,"Intel: 3 New Segments, $20 Billion In Revenue","Following its business reorganization, we examined its 3 reclassified segments including NEX which we broke down its revenues into its products with a projected growth rate of 15.8%. Furthermore, we analyzed its new discrete GPUs and determined its slight disadvantage to (8.4%) AMD and Nvidia (6.5%) based on its average benchmark performance but projected its growth of 29.2%. Lastly, we believe its acquisition of Tower Semiconductor and capacity expansion could bode well for its IFS segment growth at 232% in 2022. Projecting the revenues of these 3 new segments, we expect them to generate $20.4 billion in revenue for Intel by the year 2025."
4518237,2022-06-14,Intel Is An Excellent Long-Term Investment,"Shorter-term problems have created a buying opportunity. Intel is executing well for the first time in years. Moves into new markets can dramatically improve Intel's market cap. Intel is unique in offering top tier process technology, and CPU technology."
4524581,2022-07-20,Intel Needs To Surprise,"Intel's results and guidance are expected to be in line at best, with a realistic likelihood of a reduced outlook. If there are any surprises, they may be to the downside given rumors of further Sapphire Rapids delays, despite Intel aiming to ramp this CPU faster than Ice Lake. Intel expected to announce a new IFS whale foundry customer in H2'22. Securing AMD, Nvidia or Apple could be the real surprise but is exceedingly unlikely."
4527263,2022-07-28,Intel: Disaster Quarter,"Intel reported horrendous quarterly results. The company has major issues, and """"deteriorating macro"""" is not the core problem, as Intel's peers are faring way better and taking market share from INTC. Intel is not that inexpensive when we look at the low EPS guidance, and the dividend might not be as safe as it used to be."
4531588,2022-08-09,Intel: A Price Hike Solution,"While Intel’s Q2 results were disappointing with revenue growth of -22% YoY, we believe the reported price hike of Intel’s products could provide some cushion to its growth in 2022. With the reported price hikes, we compared it with our previous analysis where we saw its CPUs increasing on average by 9% (PC) and 20% (server). For its NEX segment, we forecasted its revenue growth higher based on ASP and unit shipments at a 5-year average of 21.1% compared to 16.7% previously. We also compiled the average GPU reported prices amid the price increases by AMD and Nvidia and forecasted its GPU revenue with price hikes."
4536458,2022-08-23,Intel: It'll Get Uglier Before It Gets Better,"Intel continues to trade at levels near its 52-week low despite Brookfield's recent investment into its foundry build-out efforts, which provided validation for its IDM 2.0 strategy. The stock's latest slump underscores investors' skepticism over Intel's near-term ability in delivering on its promise to turnaround the company under CEO Pat Gelsinger's leadership. In addition to broad-based macro headwinds, Intel is also showing elevated execution risks following consecutive quarters of underperformance resulting from internal operational mishaps. The following analysis seeks to explore the near-term fundamental prospects across Intel's core operating segments and gauge their implications on the stock's outlook."
4541010,2022-09-14,Intel Highlights Key PC Platform Innovations For 13th-Gen Core CPUs,"Intel unveiled news about several intriguing innovations on the platform technology surrounding the CPU for their upcoming 13th-Gen Core, code-named “Raptor Lake.”. Raptor Lake was designed at the company’s Israel Development Center. The new chip is also being manufactured in Israel at the company’s Fab 28, as well as at other locations around the world. Intel also discussed some important new innovations on wireless technology, AI acceleration, and on-board camera functionality."
4544467,2022-10-03,Intel: Due For Growth Rebound,"Solid financial and balance sheet for a mature company. Intel's 13th Gen Core Processor Family Potential has the capability to revolutionize standards in Semiconductor Industry. Stable and strong dividend growth with industry-leading yield; fulfills investor's needs during uncertain economic landscape. Baseline 53.30% upside under 2 valuation methods using very conservative assumptions. Economy worsens, business strategy profitability and partnerships prevent further headwind damage; ranks incredibly well amongst big-name competitors."
4546966,2022-10-17,"Intel: Gelsinger Got Hit In 4 Different Ways, Simultaneously","Intel’s current market cap is back to where it was in 2012 (about $100B). To make the picture even uglier, it has also cumulatively retained $110B of earnings. In other words, even if its CEOs have done nothing, the retained earnings alone should have more than doubled its market cap. Gelsinger, unfortunately, is the one who inherits this miserable scorecard. He’s hit by 4 different issues, simultaneously. It’s inappropriate to say it's unfair. After all, a CEO’s job is to deal with whatever comes his/her way. But it’s fair to say that the issues are not his making and he has been making all the right calls to address them in my mind."
4548178,2022-10-21,Intel: The Bad Can Get Better,"Intel has been caught up in the bear perfect storm: the financials are deteriorating due to weakened demand just as Intel is going all-in on investing in fabs and R&D. The thesis remains that investors may be overly bearish due to extrapolating Q2/Q3 figures which include a one-time inventory correction. Contrary to popular opinion, the dividend is likely not at risk, although it may depend on how fast there will be a recovery in demand. While others may be ridiculing the collapsed Mobileye IPO valuation, this presents a very compelling entry point (in the bull case its robotaxi business becomes more profitable and hence valuable than Uber). Raptor Lake has a very strong CPU line-up, and the Arc launch represents a milestone for Intel's XPU strategy."
4552050,2022-11-02,Intel After Q3 Earnings: Bear Trap,"The contraction of Intel's financials is eroding a once-core (but now antiquated) bull argument that only Intel had the required scale to follow and lead Moore’s Law. This is because Intel, despite many tries, has failed for more than a decade to diversify to new large and growing businesses. This now presents a catch-22 situation. Without organic funding available to embark on the turnaround, Intel is having to cut costs, which was one of the reasons (corporate greed) it fell behind in the first place. Put differently, lower investments (layoffs) mean a significantly increased execution risk, which has been investors’ and analysts’ main concern with Intel for years. The Q3 earnings pop was completely unwarranted, as the financials are still trending downwards (and the reorganization misplaced). Beware the bear trap (more downside)."
4553372,2022-11-04,Intel: Buy The Pullback,"We are moving Intel to a buy from a sell based on our belief that the company’s financial performance will stabilize through 1H23 and could outperform expectations in 2H23. We believe the market has now priced in most of the weakness in the PC and cloud spending, as well as the market share loss to AMD and ARM-based CPUs. We still believe INTC’s PC TAM forecast of 270-295M units for 2023 remains too high in the current macroeconomic backdrop and expect a continued soft cloud spending environment. We are getting more constructive about INTC’s ability to execute in the foundry business and believe it could be a meaningful foundry player in the next 3 to 4 years. We think INTC stock may remain a little volatile in the near term, but we believe the stock provides an attractive entry point for long-term investors."
4560049,2022-11-23,"Intel: The Good, The Bad, But Not Too Ugly","Intel is the market leader in CPUs with over a 60% share of the personal computing industry (The Good). Intel's Revenue has declined by 15% year over year (The Bad). The company generated mixed results for the third quarter as it beat both revenue and earnings expectations (but expectations were pretty low), so this was """"not too ugly"""". Intel stock is undervalued intrinsically and relative to historic multiples."
4565671,2022-12-21,"Intel: Cheap Valuation, But Past Recession Performance Suggests Caution","I know it's not the positive outlook existing owners want to hear, but a recession will likely drag Intel's price even lower. A cheap valuation exists to support price eventually. And, the company should benefit from the long-term push to build new U.S. production capacity. Turnarounds can take time (many years), and trading momentum is still quite bearish. If interested in buying shares, I would wait for lower quotes. I rate the stock a Hold for current stakeholders."
4565911,2022-12-22,Intel: Super Play On Autonomous Driving,"Following Mobileye's IPO, we believe Intel could continue to be a key partner for Mobileye for product development and could leverage its relationship with Mobileye. We believe that Qualcomm has the performance advantage over Mobileye and its competitors as it had the highest ranking in 3 out of the 5 performance metrics compared. Despite that, we believe Mobileye has the overall full stack advantage in AV solutions with the highest number of AV capabilities over competitors."
4566444,2022-12-26,"It Is What It Is, Intel Is My Rebound Bet For 2023",This is my 141st value buy endorsement for Intel. Intel has enough agility to overcome the negativity of investors/market traders. I now appreciate Intel as an AI company. Intel still owns more than 90% of Mobileye. Mobileye’s market cap has risen $10 billion since October IPO. An ad campaign to remake Intel as an AI-first company could improve its investment quality. The 38.1% CAGR of the $93.5 AI industry is a strong tailwind. I applaud that Jon Peddie Research reported Intel has 4% market share in discrete GPUs. This is already half of AMD’s 8% share. Mercury Research’s Q3 2022 report says Intel’s overall market share in x86 processors is 71.5%. This is notably higher than Q2’s 63.5%.
4566845,2022-12-29,Intel Plots Improbable Path To Zettascale,"For the first time after revealing the zettascale 2027 target in 2021 (implying 1000x in just six years), Intel has detailed the innovations that are required. As Moore’s Law will only yield around a 10x improvement, Intel envisions quite exotic new tech such as ultra-low voltage and temperature CMOS, and silicon photonics. Even if all of these innovations would be realized timely, the main issue is likely that while performance per watt may be improved sufficiently, performance per dollar may not. For example, the reason ultra-low voltage computing is uncommon is because GPU manufacturers push the voltage to improve performance per mm2 of silicon. While Intel has presented an exciting engineering challenge, there is currently no investment thesis."
4569512,2023-01-12,"Can Intel Stock Recover In 2023? No, Be Prepared For A Longer Wait","Intel's stock price dropped by -50% in 2022, and the company's poor share price last year is attributable to its server CPU market share loss and weak profitability. A meaningful recovery in INTC's stock price in 2023 is unlikely, in my view, but I have a positive opinion of Intel's turnaround potential in the long term. I maintain a Hold rating for Intel, as I think that INTC will take a few more years to engineer a complete turnaround."
4570062,2023-01-15,Intel: Sending AMD A Message With Sapphire Rapids,"Intel officially launched its Sapphire Rapid data center processors last week, aiming to mitigate potential share loss against AMD. Intel also updated its long-term PC TAM, suggesting that it still sees solid gains given secular tailwinds. INTC has outperformed the S&P 500 since its December lows, likely reflecting a better-than-expected Q4 earnings release. Will CEO Pat Geisinger & his team be able to turn things around against AMD in 2023?"
4571429,2023-01-22,"It Is What It Is, Intel Is A Buy",I reiterate the buy rating I gave Intel last December 26. The Sapphire Rapids Xeon server processors tout better AI performance than AMD’s EPYC. INTC trades below $30. It still has more upside potential because its one-year performance is still -47%. My near-term price target for INTC is still $31.20. This PT could happen after Q4 F2022 numbers are reported this coming January 26. Nvidia is helping Intel sell more AI-centric Xeon server processors. Intel is needed by Nvidia to compete better against AMD. I guesstimate that Nvidia could help sell 200k units of the $17k Sapphire Rapids Xeon 8490H server processor.
4572851,2023-01-26,Intel: A True Disaster,Intel Corporation Q4 results come in below street estimates. Q1 guidance tremendously worse than expected. Intel Corporation shares likely to continue their underperformance.
4572938,2023-01-27,Intel Q4 Reflections: Still A Value Trap,"Intel's Q4 2022 performance was a bad. And the company's outlook for early 2023 is even worse. Intel's Q4 revenue and net-income fell by 32% and 114% year over year respectively. Revenues for Q1 2023 will likely fall between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion, which could be as much as $3.5 billion below Wall-Street expectations. Investors should also consider that it is not 'only the market/ macro' environment, as Intel continues to loose market share against competitors. On the backdrop of EPS contraction though 2025, I now calculate a fair implied share price for INTC equal to $23.5/share. Intel remains a 'Sell'."
4577829,2023-02-13,Intel: Short Term Pain For Long Term Gains,"We remain bullish on Intel even after a grim 1Q23 outlook. We expect the worst of the macroeconomic headwinds and inventory correction in the PC Client and the data center markets to have been fully factored into the stock. We believe the PC market’s retreat from the pandemic boom levels has pressured Intel significantly; we are more constructive on the PC Client inventory correction cycle ending in 1H23. On the data center front, while we expect softer cloud spending in 2023, we believe Intel’s new """"Sapphire Rapid"""" server CPU is well-positioned to stamp share loss to AMD. While the stock price could remain volatile in 1H23, we continue to believe Intel provides a favorable risk-reward for longer-term investors as it works to become a meaningful foundry player."
4578062,2023-02-14,Intel: Headwinds Are Significant And Future Highly Uncertain,"Intel is facing significant challenges in the near-term as its financials are quickly deteriorating and the company is struggling with macroeconomic headwinds. Intel has had a terrible decade in which it faced many technical challenges, resulting in it falling behind the competition. While the recently released financials were once again horrible (as was the outlook), Intel does look like its on schedule regarding its product releases and technological progress. While the thesis is overly negative, government incentives and new node releases are positives for Intel. The company also still holds a significant position in the PC x86 CPU market. In my eyes, the future remains highly uncertain. There seems to be a lot depending on the success of the ambitious turnaround resulting in significant operational risks, making it a risky investment."
4579935,2023-02-20,"Intel: Dividends At Risk, But It Doesn't Matter For The Long-Term","Intel’s catastrophic performance in Q4 and a weak outlook for Q1 indicate that it would be hard for the business to become FCF-neutral in 2023. As a result, there’s a risk that the management would be required to cut the dividends at the end of the year to decrease the cash burn rate. However, Intel’s stock could be a solid investment for long-term investors due to the company’s potential to access a significant pool of public funds to decrease the costs of turnaround."
4582093,2023-02-25,"Intel: Compelling New Xeon, Dividend Reduction","After over two years of delays, Intel has launched its highly anticipated Sapphire Rapids Xeon, its biggest update in more than half a decade. As Pat Gelsinger had promised, without delays, it would have been a leadership product, obliterating AMD’s… last-gen Epyc Milan. AMD’s recent Genoa still reigns supreme. For Intel investors, this CPU is a stepping stone and proof point for what Intel could accomplish without process and design issues. Intel remains on track to the 2024-2025 turnaround. Intel finally announces dividend reduction. It is one of the many actions Intel has done to respond to the near-term demand environment. The technology progress remains on track."
4591458,2023-03-31,Intel's Data Center And AI Strategy: Opportunity Amidst Financial Challenges,"Intel projects low 20s% TAM growth through 2027, with AI inference being a significant growth area, but faces strong competition from incumbents like Nvidia. Intel's support for SYCL and its ambitious server CPU roadmap signal positive developments, but execution risks and market challenges remain. The company's data center and AI efforts show potential, but Intel must overcome financial challenges and competitive pressures to capitalize on the opportunities."
4592234,2023-04-04,"Intel Xeon: One Step Forward, Two Steps Backwards","Intel’s recent data center webinar was well received by investors, as the stock rallied upwards. My own analysis of the event is more sceptical. While Intel moved one step forward with 18A Clearwater Forest in 2025 (an unquestioned leadership product), it also moved two steps backwards. Previously rumored to feature 334 or even 512 cores, these higher core count Sierra Forest-AP parts have been canceled in favor of the unambitious 144-core Sierra Forest-SP. Diamond Rapids, the 18A P-core counterpart of Clearwater Forest, once scheduled for 2024, is now missing in the 2025 roadmap, implying a delay to 2026. Despite these additional Xeon setbacks, investors may remain bullish given (1) the process roadmap remaining on track, (2) the low valuation/stock price, and (3) the three emerging businesses."
4592724,2023-04-06,Intel: Stock Oversold On Market Headwinds,"Intel Corporation has built on its competitiveness in laptop CPUs, with its performance benchmark scores overtaking AMD for the first time. We believe its strong performance improvement is responsible for Intel’s laptop market share gain for the first time in the past 5 years. For desktop CPUs, Intel has maintained superior value in terms of performance per pricing against AMD, as it has maintained its CPU prices consistently lower than AMD. For server CPUs, Intel is disadvantaged against AMD, which has superior value in terms of performance per pricing, as its performance is almost double of Intel. Despite weakness in the PC market expected to continue in 2023, we believe the company."

Interestingly, Intel outperformed while it has yet to regain process leadership, displace Nvidia as the GPU leader, nor stem AMD's market share advances. While Intel's industry outlook has improved, it didn't look like the case in May or June 2023. So why did INTC bottom then? I had already presented that INTC reached peak pessimism as dip-buyers quietly accumulated. The market likely didn't want to show its hand so early, allowing momentum buyers to chase. As a result, INTC is another potent reminder that stocks bottom out when you least expect it. If you want to know how to assess it, make studying price action/investor psychology a core tenet in your analysis."
4662023,2024-01-09,Intel Is Overvalued Despite Operational Strengths,"Intel's AI revenue and focus on cost-saving business applications in the AI market position it well for long-term growth. Intel's investment in its foundry service and the introduction of its 5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors enhance its capabilities in the AI and data center markets.

Intel's upcoming launch of the 18A Panther Lake CPUs and strong partnerships position the company for future growth and market leadership. In essence, the turnaround appears to be working under the surface; I am bullish."
4700146,2024-06-20,Intel's Ambitious Plans Create More Problems Than Benefits,"Intel has been undergoing a massive transformation since 2021 with IDM 2.0, but so far, it has created more problems than benefits. The deprioritized core business has been losing its competitive strength and experiencing macroeconomic weakness. In addition, foundry projects seem to be far in the future, and as projects get delayed, earnings from them become less relevant for today's valuation. INTC stock appears cheap at first glance, but there is no short-term catalyst for upside, leading to my """"Hold"""" rating."
4701114,2024-06-26,Intel: Confronting Industry Shifts And ARM's Dominance,"Intel is adapting to market changes by separating Intel Products and Intel Foundry, positioning both businesses to compete better in their segments. Intel's transparency on the economics of their business can result in both firms pursuing efficiency and growth better than being consolidated into one. Intel is positioning Lunar Lake and Sierra Forest to address the potential disruption ARM poses to its core business. Even if you become more conservative than Intel's assumptions on their financial target model for their foundry to breakeven, Intel at $30 per share is almost 50% undervalued."
4702105,2024-07-02,Has Intel Found Its Bottom Again?,"Intel reported mediocre first quarter results for fiscal 2024. When looking at the new reporting structure, Intel Products - the core business of Intel - actually reported high growth rates. Management is holding on to its long-term vision of Intel Foundry generating high revenue and improving margins. And the stock is still deeply undervalued."
4702377,2024-07-04,Intel: Between A Rock (NVIDIA) And A Hard Place (AMD),"Intel continues to underperform against competitors like NVIDIA and AMD in the GPU and CPU markets, respectively. Intel is refocusing its efforts into chip manufacturing, but also specializing within the AI segment to gain an edge.

4704598,2024-07-17,Why Intel Stock Deserves A 'Strong Buy' Rating,"Looking at the financials, it's no wonder that investor skepticism about Intel's AI efforts and slow data center recovery has further impacted the stock price performance in the recent past. However, I think Intel's revenue growth in key segments like CCG and DCAI shows promising signs for future profitability. The company has ambitious goals for its foundry services, hoping to be the second-largest external foundry company by 2030; it has already secured large orders from Microsoft and others. The current EPS forecasts may be too pessimistic if Q1 marked the bottom of the cycle and management's cost-cutting initiatives helped boost Intel's margins already in Q2. Intel's valuation calculations suggest a potential 40% higher price target than the current stock price, providing a significant margin of safety."

Margins have declined, but this is due to economies of scale, and we expect them to increase in line with revenue moving forward. Intel remains the market leader in CPUs and is poised to benefit from the rise of AI CPUs."
4707761,2024-07-29,Buy Intel Stock Before Its Reputation Is Fixed,"Intel Corporation's market capitalization has dropped over 35% YTD, despite progress on 5 nodes in 4 years to compete with TSMC. Intel's financial performance remains strong with revenue and EPS growth, positioning the company for future success. Intel's reputation has suffered from crashing CPUs, but the company's outlook shows potential for growth and value as an investment."
4710105,2024-08-03,"Intel: No Pain, No Gain, Uncertain Turnaround Ahead","INTC's failure to execute its turnaround story has triggered the drastic pullback by -30%, or the equivalent -$39B in market capitalization. This is worsened by the underwhelming FQ2'24 financial performance, dividend suspension, and drastic layoffs through 2025, with its reversal hanging in balance. Combined with the uncertain monetization of its foundry ambitions and deteriorating balance sheet, INTC's investment thesis remains underwhelming at these bottom levels. Moving forward, the management needs to miraculously """"pull a rabbit out of the hat"""" to not only survive the highly competitive industry, but to eventually thrive and regain the market's/ shareholders' trust. Only time may tell."
4710630,2024-08-05,Intel: Bad Q2 Exacerbates Long Term Trend,"Intel's latest report reinforce concerns about the business' future. Intel's pivot to the foundry business is risky and exacerbates the troubled position of the business. Declining revenues and collapsing margins in key segments indicate poor operational performance and execution issues. Financials show a deteriorating business with declining revenues, increasing debt, dilution of shares, and negative free cash flow."
4711374,2024-08-07,Intel's Turnaround Will Be More Painful Than Anticipated,"Intel experienced a significant sell-off after a disappointing financial performance as the firm attempts to separate the fab & fabless businesses.

4718719,2024-09-03,Intel: Relentless Carnage Demands Damage Control,"Intel Corporation's Q2 earnings report was disastrous, and there was a bleak Q3 forecast. Gross margin headwinds and higher non-core business charges hurt Intel, despite efforts to reduce spending and improve profitability. Intel is exploring strategic options, including a potential spin-off of its foundry business and significant spending cuts, to boost shareholder value. Despite some positive developments, Intel remains in damage control mode, with better chip stock alternatives available for investors. Lost your shirt here? Let us help you get back to even."

4721924,2024-09-18,Intel's Rebound: Why I Am Skeptical,"Intel stock remains a hold despite being at multi-year lows due to poor earnings, weak guidance, and management struggles. Intel's long-term performance is dismal, with the stock down 42% over the last decade, indicating chronic underperformance. A new CEO, preferably an outsider, could potentially drive significant corporate culture reform and improve Intel's competitive position. Until Intel demonstrates consistent, better-than-expected earnings and innovation, INTC stock could remain range-bound between $20-$30."
4722119,2024-09-19,Is Intel's Turnaround Story Over? (Rating Downgrade),"Intel targets over $10 billion in savings by 2025, reducing OpEx to $17.5 billion — a 20% cut. Plans to decrease workforce by over 15% by 2025, aiming to streamline operations and boost profitability. Intel’s Panther Lake and Lunar Lake CPUs target the AI PC market, which is expected to exceed 50% by 2026. Despite revenue growth, Intel reported $2.8 billion in operating losses in Q2 due to higher manufacturing costs. Intel aims to regain process leadership with Intel 18A by 2025, but execution risks lead to a hold rating."
4722228,2024-09-20,Intel: A Perfect Example Of Why 'Cheap' Doesn't Always Mean 'Buy',"Intel's transformation into a foundry business has led to declining core business revenues and profitability, with no immediate catalysts for stock growth. Government funding will not solve the company's problems; INTC's future profitability remains uncertain, and the stock continues to underperform the broader market. The stock appears extremely cheap, trading below book value, but lacks the necessary catalysts to justify an investment. I maintain a """"Hold"""" rating on Intel due to limited downside risk, significant opportunity costs, and uncertain future prospects."
4724293,2024-10-01,Intel: Spectacular September Comeback,"Intel Corporation's turnaround, led by CEO Pat Gelsinger, focuses on restoring technological competitiveness, with 18A products expected by H2 '25, despite recent revenue declines and layoffs. The reason the turnaround hasn't succeeded is that it only really starts with 18A, which is on track, but ultimately only has an indirect effect on its financial performance/revenue. Intel's stock trades below book value, presenting an investment opportunity based on potential gross and profit margin growth, with a possible return to $30-40 per share. Risks include aligning cost structure with current revenue, but improved economics and cost savings from the reorganization offer a path to profitability. Intel delivered a stacked September with three major leadership product launches. While a Qualcomm merger might secure its financial stability, it is not required."
4725112,2024-10-05,Intel: Too Cheap To Ignore (Technical Analysis),"Intel's stock experienced extreme volatility, plummeting nearly 40% before rebounding 21%, only to drop again after disappointing earnings and cost-cutting measures. Despite the volatility, Intel's price to book ratio is at a 30-year low, presenting a compelling value compared to competitors like AMD, QCOM, and TSM.

4736197,2024-11-11,Intel Stock: It's Not Too Late To Buy The Dip,"I maintain my bullish rating on Intel, believing the stock is undervalued after its massive YoY drop, presenting a buying opportunity for brave medium-term investors. Despite Q3 2024 challenges, Intel's cost reduction and new product launches, like new processors for AI, could drive recovery and future growth. Intel's partnership with AMD and AWS, along with ambitious restructuring, aims to regain market share and improve financial performance. I think that INTC will continue to make efforts, and somewhere in 2025, we might see a turnaround in the company's fortunes, which could lead to the stock's medium-term growth. My valuation calculations say that the stock is undervalued by 31% over the next 2 years as the firm emerges from its challenging period."
4738484,2024-11-19,Intel: This Is The Time To Buy Again,"Intel's shares have been volatile, but Q3 results showed progress in cost reduction and potential for recovery, boosting investor optimism. New AI CPUs and Gaudi 3 AI accelerator launches could drive growth in Intel's Client Computing and Data Center businesses. Intel's foundry business has growth catalysts, including a custom AI chip deal with Amazon and a $3 billion grant under the Chips and Science Act.

4739140,2024-11-20,Intel: Can It Survive Another Year Of Node Process Setbacks?,"Intel Corporation's Q3 '24 results showed impairments and write-offs, but the core business performance was better than expected, though not an inflection point in its turnaround. Intel's aggressive node development plan still lags behind TSMC and Samsung, impacting its ability to compete in high-end microchips. Despite strong early 2024 sales, Intel's Client Computing Group and Data Center & AI segment show mixed performance, with declining INTC margins and sales volatility."
4741478,2024-12-02,"Intel: May Be A Value Trap, Uncertain Growth Prospects","INTC continues to report an uncertain turnaround, underwhelming FQ3'24 performance, and missed opportunities in the AI/ foundry sectors. Despite a +30% recovery from its August 2024 low, the stock has underperformed the broader market and semiconductor peers, highlighting its ongoing struggles. INTC's restructuring, including layoffs and reduced capex, contrasts sharply with its competitors' intensified investments during the AI capex boom, further dampening its growth prospects. The management's $100B foundry ambitions are likely to trigger further headwinds in its Free Cash Flow generation and balance sheet health over the next few years. This is also why we believe INTC may be a potential value trap, with its seemingly low stock prices coming with mixed growth potential."
4741754,2024-12-03,"Intel Is Changing For The Better, It's Time To Buy","Intel Corporation has been removed from the Dow Jones 30, replaced by NVIDIA Corp, reflecting their poor performance over the past five years. Intel's stock is down 57% from five years ago, underperforming compared to other large semiconductor companies. Intel was once dominant in CPU hardware, but the shift to GPU hardware has left them struggling to compete. The transition in the semiconductor industry from CPU to GPU dominance has significantly impacted Intel's market position and stock performance.

4742078,2024-12-04,Intel: Prospects Of A New CEO Could Improve Sentiment (Rating Upgrade),"Despite Intel's historical underperformance and management issues, I'm upgrading my rating from hold to buy due to potential positive sentiment changes. Intel's struggles stem from manufacturing challenges, competition, strategic missteps, and poor financial performance, all linked to poor management. Pat Gelsinger's dismissal is a positive step, but Intel needs an outside CEO to reform its corporate culture and drive a sustainable turnaround. Intel has significant potential; with the right leadership, it could see improved profitability and a 25-33% stock price increase in the near term."
4742361,2024-12-05,Intel: The Worst Is Not Over Yet,"After years of underperformance, there’s a risk that Intel will continue to lose its competitive advantages and won’t be able to properly revive its business anytime soon. The latest departure of its CEO Pat Gelsinger shows that Intel needs a new strategy if it wants to recover and avoid another lost decade. We believe that INTC is a sell right now."
4742684,2024-12-06,Intel: Examining The Track Records Of The New CEOs In Consideration,"The ousting of Patrick Gelsinger as CEO is my opinion an admission of a failed turnaround strategy with Intel missing the AI bet and losing market share in the traditional CPU business. Prospective new CEO Lip-Bu Tan has a stellar track record at Cadence Design and intimate knowledge of Intel, with a clear idea of what different things ought to be done. Matt Murphy's successful turnaround at Marvell also makes him a candidate for Intel's CEO position, but he is committed to Marvell, making his Intel appointment unlikely. Lip-Bu Tan is my base case for most likely CEO. I expect his appointment to lead to operating margin improvement driven by cuts to bloated middle management personnel at Intel. I expect the new CEO's compensation to be generous, potentially exceeding Gelsinger's 2021 package."
4745800,2024-12-21,Intel Is Still A Good Bet,"Intel's current struggles are largely due to past decisions, not recent leadership, and the company is not in danger of bankruptcy. Despite issues with Arrow Lake's release, it's a strong product, and Intel's investment in fabs is crucial for future performance. Intel's GPU market entry shows promise, but immediate impact on earnings is limited; long-term potential is significant. At $19, Intel is undervalued, with strong positions in client and data center markets, making it a buy despite recent setbacks."
4748034,2025-01-07,Intel: Time To Dump Shares And Not Look Back,"Intel's market share performance in the Client Computing Group, which generates nearly 55% of its revenue and the bulk of its operating income, is deeply concerning. In CCG, Intel has been steadily losing market share for years, and there are no indications that this trend is easing. If anything, Intel's share losses seem to be accelerating. Shareholders likely won't get anything out of Intel anytime soon because the free cash flow pressure on the business is high: consensus estimates expect a cash outflow even in 2026. In conclusion, Intel looks like a big loser. And 2025 may be the time to finally part with any shares investors may still hold."
4748341,2025-01-08,Why Intel Is Poised To Thrive As 'King Of The Fabs' Amid Rising Geopolitical Tensions,"Rising U.S.-China tensions and the potential for a Taiwan conflict will boost the onshoring of chip manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe. Chips that power tech in general and the AI revolution, in particular, make avoiding supply chain disruption a strategic issue. Intel’s US/Europe-based fabs make it a key player for a de-globalizing semiconductor industry. Intel's stock market dog status and awful price-performance make it a contrarian value investment with a significant upside."
4749370,2025-01-14,Intel Stock: Prioritize Long-Term Thinking (Rating Upgrade),"I believe Intel is now too undervalued despite recent struggles, with long-term potential driven by AI advancements and cost-cutting measures. Intel's Q3 FY2024 results were disappointing, but the market's pessimism offers a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Intel's AI-specific PCs and new Xeon 6P CPUs should boost revenues and likely profitability, aiding its turnaround plan. I think the market is too pessimistic about Intel's role in the AI-driven future. The upside to today's EPS projections may be massive, making INTC quite cheap in the next 2-3 years. Prioritizing long-term thinking in this kind of situation is crucial, so I'm thinking of starting to build a long position in INTC stock shortly."
4749659,2025-01-15,Intel Could Dominate GPU Space With The Right Plan,"Intel is currently struggling, while AMD has risen to prominence under Lisa Su's leadership. INTC needs strong leadership and a clear vision to turn things around and thrive again. The company is having success in the low-end GPU sector. Intel could turn things around through a combination of CPU, GPU, and Foundry."
4750705,2025-01-20,Intel: Moment Of Truth Rapidly Approaching,"Intel's upcoming Q4 earnings could mark a turning point, with focus on restructuring progress and Gaudi®3 AI accelerator up-scaling. Low expectations set the stage for potential outperformance in 2025, with Intel possibly returning to profitability and achieving a stock re-rating. Intel's restructuring and impairment charges have weighed heavily, but positive news on Gaudi®3 could trigger a strong price reaction. Despite past disappointments, Intel's potential to monetize non-essential businesses and improve data center performance suggests it shouldn't be written off yet."
4750819,2025-01-21,Intel: No Easy Path,"Intel faces significant challenges, including a CEO replacement, lagging AI chip development, and a struggling foundry business, leading to a bearish long-term outlook. Buyout rumors involving GlobalFoundries, Qualcomm, and Elon Musk offer potential short-term trading opportunities, but regulatory and financial hurdles make a deal complex. The chip giant has a weak balance sheet with massive net debt, and underperformance in AI GPU and data center CPU markets limiting growth prospects and investor confidence. The only plausible short-term upside is an unlikely buyout; otherwise, Intel will face continued financial pressure and potential new lows."
4750730,2025-01-21,Why I'm Buying The Intel Acquisition Rumors,"Intel's market cap has stagnated for 30 years, but deep value exists due to its core CPU segment and potential for a turnaround. The CPU market remains profitable with limited competition, and any improvement in Intel's other businesses could create significant value. Whether the M&A happens or not, this could have strategic changes or management shake-ups at Intel that benefit shareholders. Despite risks, I consider Intel a speculative buy for a small portion of my portfolio, given its current undervaluation and potential upside."
4751189,2025-01-22,Intel: Misses AI Boom And No Hyperscaler To Buy The Company,"Intel Corporation struggles to capitalize on AI growth due to its weaker CPU performance compared to GPUs and declining market share against AMD. Intel's venture into the GPU market has failed, and its server GPUs remain unproven, limiting its AI growth opportunities. Late adoption of ASML's EUV technology has hurt Intel's production capabilities, leading to delays and loss of market share. Intel's uncertain future and potential government support make INTC stock a speculative buy with a 13% upside, but significant risks remain."
4752391,2025-01-28,Intel: Hoping For A Buyout Isn't An Investment Strategy,"China's DeepSeek has forced a serious rethink of doubling down on AI chips. Intel's struggles in the AI chips race could get a respite if the hype on accelerated computing dies off due to DeepSeek's """"revelation."""" Rumors of Elon Musk's interest and capability in acquiring Intel now seems like a long shot, if anything. Analysts see Intel's performance bottomed out in 2024, suggesting sunnier days ahead. I argue why investors should remain cautious about Intel's fundamental thesis and not return because of a possible buyout rumor."
4752502,2025-01-28,AMD Vs Intel: Battle For CPU Dominance,"AMD and Intel are fiercely competing in the x86 CPU market, with AMD gaining market share in 2024 despite Intel's performance improvements.

4753602,2025-01-30,Intel: The Empire Strikes Back,"Intel Corporation's Q4 earnings showed weak results year-over-year (as expected) but significant sequential improvement, supporting our view that the turnaround is underway. It was a great print overall. Margins improved sequentially, with adjusted gross margins approaching 40%, driven by cost cuts and efficiencies, though still down from last year. Segment performance showed positive trends in each segment, but data center and AI was only modestly better than Q3. The Q1 outlook is a bit light, but we have argued the true inflection would take place after Q1 2025. INTC shares are up right now, but we think a new CEO has a massive opportunity to really take the company meaningfully into the future."
4753856,2025-01-31,"Intel Q4: There's No Good News Here, Sell Now","Intel Corporation has underperformed the S&P500 since my last 'Sell' update on the stock, and Q4 FY2024 results provide fresh reasons to remain bearish. INTC delivered weak revenue guidance that has become a norm. Q1 FY2025 revenues are expected to fall 11-18% QoQ due to seasonality but also a whole litany of other reasons. Intel's data center business' outlook is hit with the rude shock of cancellations and further delays of long-awaited product launches. The Panther Lake CPU launch is a positive catalyst to look out for in H2 FY2025. Also, keep on eye on the bleeding FCF trends every quarter. INTC stock is trading near fair value on a 1-yr fwd P/E basis, and the long-term technicals remain firmly bearish."
4753807,2025-01-31,Intel Q4: Can They Turn It Around?,"Intel Corporation faces significant challenges, including shrinking market share and revenue, but has a solid turnaround plan addressing core issues. The plan includes new manufacturing projects, a foundry business spin-off, and partnerships with AWS to regain technology leadership.

INTC investors should brace for volatility as Intel navigates fierce competition and executes its turnaround strategy."
4754543,2025-02-04,"Intel: Attractive Price, But Needs Caution","Over the last three years, my Sell rating for Intel stock has been spot on as the company faced massive challenges in the foundry business. With the recent change in management and better-than-expected numbers in the earnings, I am upgrading the stock to a Hold. The most important factor for Intel’s future performance will be the choice of the next senior management. Intel’s ambitious 18A node chips are stuck at 10% yield and are also trailing TSM’s upcoming 2nm technology. The stock has been beaten down over the last few years, but it is showing signs of improvement which can deliver better sentiment towards the stock."
4756619,2025-02-10,Intel: It's Time To Let Go,"Intel has lost 65% in value since 2021 and has suspended its dividend. Intel's core x86 CPU business is losing market share to AMD, while Intel's gross margin is also far behind its peers. Intel's new leadership faces urgent decisions to avoid falling further behind competitors like AMD, NVIDIA, and TSMC in key growth markets.

4757429,2025-02-12,Intel: Poised To Rise From The Ashes,"Intel's 4Q24 earnings showed a 7% YoY sales drop, but Network and Edge grew 10% YoY, indicating potential for future growth. Despite a small profit beat, Intel faces challenges in 2025 unless it makes strategic business decisions, possibly divesting parts of its portfolio. New high-performance CPUs and AI microchips could drive Intel's growth in 2025, with Panther Lake launches potentially boosting sales. Intel's valuation is attractive with a low profit multiple and significant re-rating potential, making it an interesting investment despite current challenges."
4759258,2025-02-18,TMSC And Intel: Just The Beginning Of A New Onshoring Reality,Intel's stock is up 18% since my January 8th tip and there's further upside. The US can't rely on adversaries for critical tech. The government encouraging chip onshoring with $30bn of incentives underlines the catalysts which are a boon for Intel. DeepSeek's 'distillation' of OpenAI's models underscores the need for onshore semiconductor production to protect tech and sovereignty. Intel and GlobalFoundries are 'chump change' for giants like Nvidia; $50 per share for Intel is not an unrealistic target.
4764017,2025-03-03,Intel: There Is No Reason For The Stock To Rise And For You To Buy,"Intel stock has experienced significant volatility, dropping from $62 in mid-2021 to $18.90 in September 2024, despite broader semiconductor gains. In 2025, INTC is up 15.8% year-to-date, driven by takeover rumors involving Broadcom and TSMC. Potential takeovers, especially by TSMC, face significant approval challenges, making them unlikely to materialize. The rally is not justified by JD Vance's statements or unconfirmed takeover rumors; INTC needs new leadership and a better market environment. Until there is no significant reason to think that INTC's core problems will be solved, INTC is a sell."
4767396,2025-03-13,Nvidia Could Be Joining Intel After All,"Intel's investment thesis hinges on the strategic importance of semiconductor production for future economies and warfare, driving U.S. efforts to boost domestic production. Intel's struggles stem from past leadership decisions, with AMD and Nvidia eroding its market share and high fab costs necessitating external assistance. A potential joint venture with AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and TSMC could revitalize Intel, offering vertical integration benefits and increased market share. Investing in Intel is moderately risky; success hinges on the joint venture rumor and Intel's ability to address its consumer and server CPU market challenges."
4768188,2025-03-17,Intel: Poised For Turnaround With New CEO,"Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is driving a disciplined turnaround focused on accountability, execution, and restoring Intel's tech leadership. Intel is executing an ambitious plan to regain semiconductor manufacturing supremacy with breakthroughs like the 18A node, new CPUs, and expanding its foundry business. Intel has ample cash, significant cost-cutting measures, and massive subsidies from governments and private partners, greatly reducing execution risk. Despite positive momentum, Intel faces intense competition, a history of missed deadlines, and ongoing execution risks that could stall or limit the turnaround."
4768488,2025-03-18,Intel's Turnaround: A Matter Of National Security,"In its core desktop x86 CPU market, Intel is rapidly losing market share to AMD's new Ryzen 9000 Series. The situation is pretty much the same in the laptop x86 CPU market, with significant market share losses to Arm's architecture. On the manufacturing side, the situation is not better. Intel Foundry continues to report significant operating losses and to absorb large amounts of capital. Fab 52 in Arizona is expected to start commercial production with Intel's new 18A manufacturing process by the end of 2025. It is a make-or-break moment. In the event of financial distress, it would not be in the interests of the U.S. Government to let Intel fail, as INTC's manufacturing base is of strategic importance in the midst of rising geopolitical tensions."
4769003,2025-03-20,Intel: A Sum-Of-Parts Valuation Analysis Shows Significant Upside,"Intel, with declining revenues, margins, and asset efficiency, faces significant challenges. Despite restructuring efforts, Intel's financial performance continues to decline, with FY24 revenues down 33% from FY21 and net income turning negative. A sum of parts of three independent units - Intel Products, Intel Foundry, and Architecture Design - points to significant shareholder value, with a potential total market cap of $393 billion. The path forward involves either a successful restructuring or a strategic breakup, both aiming to restore profitability and enhance agility, justifying a buy rating."
4770320,2025-03-25,Intel: Why A Break-Up Is Becoming Unavoidable (Downgrade),"Intel faces severe challenges, including missed opportunities in GPUs and AI accelerators, and substantial losses in its Foundry segment. A break-up or spin-off of Intel's Foundry business could be a strategic move to improve profitability and focus on core segments. Intel's new CEO aims to prioritize Foundry and AI chips, but drastic measures are needed to address cash flow and operational issues. Despite Intel's struggles, its long-term profit potential remains, especially if a permanent solution for Foundry is found."
4770359,2025-03-26,Intel: Chasing The Recent Spike Could Be A Big Mistake (Rating Downgrade),"Intel's newly appointed CEO Lip-Bu Tan has driven much optimism back into the beleaguered stock, but many questions remain. Intel's bloated workforce and foundry struggles require Intel to overcome years of poor execution even as its rivals continue advancing. Tan's ability to turn around Intel might hinge on his decision to spin off or keep Intel Foundry. Unless Intel can provide a clear path to recovering its profitability while scaling up its foundry business, the road ahead looks perilous. I argue why INTC's recent outperformance has afforded investors a great opportunity to rotate and get out of the stock. Don't waste the chance."
4775295,2025-04-15,Intel: The Worst May Be Behind This Chip Giant,"The Intel Corporation stock selloff seen since mid-2021 has already priced in most of the bad news. Now, I think there are potential bullish catalysts for recovery. Intel's Q4 FY2024 results showed resilience, with revenue and EPS beating expectations driven by Client Computing Group's performance. The new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, and strategic moves like asset monetization and reduced CapEx aim to strengthen Intel's turnaround and market positioning. Potential risks include U.S.-China trade tensions and skepticism about profitability, but bullish catalysts like the 18A process and AI PC market support a 40% upside for INTC stock."
4775242,2025-04-15,Intel Has More Going For It Than You Think,"Focused asset sales and Trump tariffs on imported semiconductors could significantly impact Intel's valuation and future profitability. A foundry asset partnership, with ownership stakes sold to the top chip names in America could net $15-20 billion for Intel, while still keeping a substantial position. Intel's majority ownership in Mobileye, Altera and other assets could raise an extra $15+ billion, if sold outright, reducing debt and slashing non-core operating losses. A net debt-free balance sheet and dramatically improved earnings by 2027 should benefit current Intel buyers at $20 per share."
4775166,2025-04-15,"Intel: Ignore The Tariffs, Buy The Turnaround","I reiterate my buy opinion on Intel, despite recent market and tariff turbulence, with the stock outperforming the S&P 500 and potential JV with TSMC as a catalyst. INTC’s strong core business, economic nationalism trends, and new CEO Lip-bu Tan’s aligned incentives support a potential turnaround and undervaluation. INTC’s valuation is rock bottom, with its CPU business alone justifying a higher market cap, and the foundry business holds significant untapped potential. Risks include US/China tariff escalation, JV etc arrangements still uncertain and potential short-term downturns, but the risk-reward is high, making INTC an attractive speculative buy."
4776522,2025-04-21,Intel: On The Verge Of A Massive Comeback,"Intel has significant growth opportunities due to the rising demand for AI chips and its strategic advantage in producing chips in its own foundries.

4778204,2025-04-25,Intel: A New Hope,"Intel Corporation's Q1 2025 earnings beat expectations, but mixed results and a weak Q2 outlook suggest a longer turnaround under the new leadership of CEO Lip-Bu Tan. Despite recent struggles, Intel's data center and AI segments showed growth, and the company is streamlining operations to regain its engineering prowess. The current INTC stock pullback into the high teens may be the last chance to buy shares cheaply, as we believe in Lip-Bu Tan's vision. We expect Intel's performance to improve in H2 2025, driven by restructuring efforts and new product launches like Panther Lake and Intel 18A."
4778824,2025-04-28,Intel's Turnaround Narrative Falters Amid Structural Challenges,"Intel Corporation's Q1 2025 revenue beat expectations, but underlying issues like margin pressure, competitive weaknesses, and operational complexity persist, casting doubt on its turnaround. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan's leadership hasn't reversed Intel's decline; gross margins are expected to drop further in Q2, and free cash flow remains deeply negative. Client Computing and Data Center segments are shrinking, with Intel facing stiff competition from AMD and ARM processors, and the foundry business continues to burn cash. Despite cost-cutting measures, including a 20% workforce reduction, Intel's structural problems remain, making INTC stock turnaround prospects uncertain and speculative."
4779665,2025-04-30,Intel Pushes Foundry Business Forward,"At Intel’s recent Direct Connect conference, new CEO Lip-Bu Tan made it clear that not only do they have no intention of spinning off their chip-making foundry business, but they’re actually doubling down to regain their world-class foundry heritage. The company used the event to update the market on its forthcoming 18A process (which Intel’s products group will use for its Panther Lake line of mobile CPUs to be released later this year) and highlighted numerous technological advancements in both its main process technologies as well as its advanced packaging capabilities. Intel didn't announce any new foundry clients at Direct Connect, but it did make it clear that there’s a new degree of focus on customer service and on delivering what potential clients want. To that end, the company announced a few new variations to both the 18A and 14A process nodes that had previously been introduced."
4781970,2025-05-05,Intel: Undervalued Even Without A Turnaround,"Intel's current financial performance is poor, but Q1 2025 results exceeded expectations, with revenue at $12.67 billion and a gross profit margin of 39.2%. I recommend buying Intel stock, valuing two scenarios: maintaining the vertical model and selling the foundry business, with potential values of $28 and $55 per share, respectively. Intel's strategic challenge lies in managing both design and manufacturing; selling the foundry business could simplify operations and boost profitability. Despite market challenges, I trust the new CEO to turn around INTC, making it a high-risk, high-return investment opportunity."
4784215,2025-05-09,Intel: 2025 Will Be A Rebound Year,"Intel reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings despite no revenue growth, with adjusted EPS of $0.13 and revenues of $12.7B, beating estimates. Intel's restructuring is ongoing: the chipmaker sold a majority stake in Altera and focuses on core processor manufacturing for consumer and data center markets. Generative AI spending trends heavily work in favor of the chip-making industry. Intel's shares trade at a 24.7X P/E ratio, but restructuring gains should put the company on track for strong EPS growth going forward. Key risks include potential restructuring failure and weak data center execution, but strong demand trends support Intel's growth prospects in this segment."
4786011,2025-05-13,Intel's Massive Layoffs Speak Opportunity,"Intel Corporation, despite recent missteps, remains a significant player in the CPU industry with a market cap under $90 billion. The company has outperformed expectations, driven by a new CEO and strategic focus on correct decisions. Intel's strong domestic advantages and storied history present a unique investment opportunity. The company's future challenges are acknowledged, but its strategic direction offers INTC potential for growth."
4788583,2025-05-20,Intel Is Having An Existential Crisis And Risks Losing More Market Share,"Intel faces ongoing growth headwinds in client and AI data center markets, losing share to AMD and Nvidia despite new design efforts. Intel's data center market share by revenue has declined from 61% in 2021 to 11% in 2024. Recapture share may not be feasible.
