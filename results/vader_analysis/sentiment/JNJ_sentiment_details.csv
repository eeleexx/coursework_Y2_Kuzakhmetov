For example, sales of Darzalex, an anticancer medication, were $2.88 billion in the second quarter of 2024, up 18.4% year-on-year.

The deal also brings Intra-Cellular Therapies' early-stage pipeline that adds to the long-term upside potential of the deal. Intellectual property risk on Caplyta is substantially reduced with last week's settlement with Sandoz, but not entirely eliminated as it does not stop other generic manufacturers from trying.
