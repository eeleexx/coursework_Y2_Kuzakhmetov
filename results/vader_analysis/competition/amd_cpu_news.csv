4241845,2019-02-18,Meridian Contrarian Fund Q4 2018 Commentary,"Meridian funds have been investing for their shareholders with an eye toward the long term. ArrowMark Colorado Holdings serves as the investment adviser to the Meridian Funds and brings a management team with decades of experience in both traditional and alternative investment management. Includes detailed analysis of Meridian Contrarian Fund's positions in NKTR, AMD, GPK, NEM, MLNX, and BNFT. The Meridian Contrarian Fund (the “Fund”) returned -18.70% (net) for the quarter, underperforming its benchmark, the Russell 2500 Index, which returned -18.49%."
4244084,2019-02-25,AMD's Long-Term Target Prices,"Street analysts have been very optimistic about AMD’s long-term fundamentals, assuming China uncertainty, crypto weakness, and the Fed’s tight interest rate policy will become headwinds blown over by 2H 2019. Wall Street’s wisdom expects that AMD’s Ryzen and EPYC chips will continue to be the key drivers for sales growth. AMD’s strategy of regaining CPU market share through lower-end server CPUs has paid off at the expense of a structurally lower margin than Nvidia and Intel. Invading into Intel’s dominated high-end corporate IT server space and data center allows AMD to expand its margin in the low 40%'s by early 2020. Based on the optimistic forecast fundamentals, AMD’s longer-term stock price path can be sketched out to hit $33 one year out and $38 by 2021."
4247478,2019-03-08,How Much Market Share AMD Needs To Be A $30 Stock,"AMD’s share price has been moving as if there is a zero-sum gain between Intel and AMD’s CPU market share. Historically, AMD stock price changes have been more related to market share changes than to revenue changes. Aided by EPYC Naples and incoming Rome, AMD server market share has reached to 3.2% in 4Q 2018 and looks to “take 3 generations to gain server market shares.”. With a current PC total revenue market share at 8.5%, the Street’s consensus estimates predict that AMD’s market share may reach 10% in late 2020. For every 1% gain in total market share, AMD share price will increase by $0.66. For AMD to reach $30 a share, its market share has to increase to 20%."
4247790,2019-03-11,Intel Vs. AMD: Battle For Market Share,"2018 was a great year for both Intel and AMD, particularly in the CPU market. AMD's top-line increased 23% as they gained market share from Intel, while Intel themselves managed a 13% revenue increase by inflating their CPU prices on the market. My forecast of the CPU market share between these two rivals for the next 4 years indicates their monopoly of the market may be ending. I identified a significant threat to the traditional x86 CPU market in the rise of ARM-based processors which are rapidly creeping into the market."
4248145,2019-03-12,Advanced Micro Devices: The Better Data Center Play,Nvidia bought Mellanox for premium to advanced high-performance computing in data centers. AMD trades very favorably compared to Mellanox at the buyout price of $125 per share. The overlooked AMD story is vast gross margin improvements from sector low levels of 40% to industry norms above 60%.
4253319,2019-04-08,AMD Vs. Google: CPUs Vs. Streaming,AMD is not the choice CPU for Google's Stadia - this was (erroneously) taken as bad news in the market. Serious gamers - those willing to spend their hard-earning cash on CPU-heavy products - are not taking Stadia seriously. Pre-earnings drift implies excess returns of 2% for investor buying one month ahead of earnings.
4254705,2019-04-16,Why Computex Is A Positive Catalyst For AMD's Stock,AMD is widely expected to announce a new Ryzen chip. Mid-range Navi GPU refresh expected. Revenue growth prospects improve after product announcements at Computex.
4257679,2019-04-29,AMD Q1 Earnings: It's All About The Second Half,"Without any positive material information, AMD’s share price has already increased more than 40% from an obviously negative Q4 earnings report. Bulls may have bought in to management’s wishful thinking of a better second half of 2019. The market may have reacted to a friendlier macro environment. For 2H 2019, AMD’s CPU revenue is expected to increase if China's gaming weakness improves. The server market share may increase if cloud-spending cuts improve. AMD’s GPU market share gain may be slowed by Nvidia's Turing launch, their presence in PC GPUs and the AI training. While 3% of AMD’s “air” in share prices has been taken out by Intel's Q1 earnings, the post-earnings price move should largely depend on Dr. Su’s Q3 and Q4 guidance."
4257983,2019-04-30,AMD: Halftime Report,"After the success of a hedged portfolio built around an AT&T position in 2017, I started presenting similar portfolios built around other stocks, including AMD in January. Here, I update the performance of the AMD portfolio halfway through its planned six-month duration. This portfolio is up 6.41% so far, lagging both its components (unhedged) and SPY. I explain why."
4265099,2019-05-19,AMD: Mid-Year Update - Incredibly Strong Performer,"AMD has gone up 50% since I last updated on the investment. The company has done incredibly well since early 2018, when I first recommended it. The company is continuing down its path of innovation and plans to release its next-generation products soon. This should cement the company's lead, especially in CPUs. I recommend investing in AMD for the long-term. The company should continue to reward shareholders well."
4265254,2019-05-20,AMD: David And Goliath All Over Again,"AMD shares are up a staggering 48% YTD, and 134% Y/Y. The fun might just be getting started. The story of AMD is a repeat of David and Goliath. Except this time, AMD is going after two Goliaths, and is winning. AMD's server roadmap, particularly within CPUs, is quite interesting as it taps into a $25 billion addressable market where Intel is the sole provider of solutions. AMD is set to expand significantly over the coming years, and take significant business from Nvidia and Intel. Despite all my optimism on the business's fundamentals, it is difficult to wrap my head around AMD's valuation. Initiating at HOLD, $28 PT."
4267110,2019-05-29,AMD: Valuation On 35x Forward P/E,"Compared with Intel and Nvidia, AMD recent share price has been largely unmoved by the macro picture and industry-specific factors. It appears that the market has priced in AMD’s ability to steal Intel’s CPU and Nvidia’s GPU market share with EPYC growth, the launches of 7nm products and Navi. Using a revenue perspective, AMD’s fair value should be between $26 and $32. AMD is undervalued by 5%-10%. Using an earnings perspective, AMD’s fair value should be between $21 and $24.  AMD is overvalued by 15%-20%. The fact that AMD currently trades closer to the revenue-based fair value suggests that investors still value AMD’s market share over its profitability."
4275238,2019-07-16,Nvidia Should Not Wage A Price War Against AMD,"Nvidia has been historically blessed by its superior GPU product performance. Nvidia has a relatively flat demand curve; units demanded is mainly driven by product performance and less by product pricing. Nvidia has felt the increasing pressure to respond to AMD’s new GPU product roll out at a low ASP. Nvidia’s inelastic demand curve suggests that changing prices will have less impact on market share changes. As Nvidia stock price has been typically more responsive to revenue and EPS, not to market share, it would be an ineffective defense for Nvidia to wage a price war."
4279603,2019-07-31,AMD Portfolio: Final Performance,"In January, I presented a hedged portfolio built around a position in Enbridge, designed for conservative investors unwilling to risk a decline of more than 12%. These portfolios last six months, so here I update this one's final performance. This portfolio returned 13.19% over six months, net of hedging and trading costs. This exceeded the 8.25% expected return for our site estimated for it in January."
4283281,2019-08-08,AMD: The Upgrades Are Coming,"AMD just snagged Google and Twitter as clients with the launch of its EPYC Rome processor. The Q2 earnings transcript suggests that the Q3 guidance did not factor in Google and Twitter, meaning a positive Q3 surprise is likely. Since Google and Twitter are onboard with AMD's superior product, it's likely that other Intel clients will follow suit. The surprise market share growth will probably result in analyst upgrades. We said it twice recently, we'll say it again - buy aggressively."
4288291,2019-08-27,AMD: Full Value Myth,AMD has taken a performance lead with the release of the Epyc 2 chips. New customers like Twitter and Google provide more confidence for 20% market share in the data center space. AMD doesn't trade at full value at $30. The stock has reasonable targets of $10 billion in revenues and a $1.75 EPS.
4288508,2019-08-28,Why The Market May Be Undervaluing AMD's Potential,"AMD currently undervalued, even by conservative valuation estimates. AMD's new 7nm Zen-2 architecture is far superior to Intel offerings in both PC market and far more lucrative data center market. AMD has secured the games consoles market and now has the technological capability to challenge NVIDIA in the high performance GPU market."
4292079,2019-09-17,Intel Vs. AMD: Losing The Battle But Winning The War,"Due to its sheer size, Intel stock price is historically more sensitive to revenue growth than to market share. Intel has a good chance to win the CPU war if 3Q revenue is ready to ramp from a renewed corporate IT budget and the scheduled 10nm launch. In contrast, due to its small market share, AMD’s stock price is more sensitive to market share changes than to revenue growth. AMD’s relative valuation will increase as it will win the battle of market share increase against Intel from its 7nm new product offerings. Relative to AMD, Intel is considerably undervalued, given the expected market share and revenue growth."
4297960,2019-10-22,AMD's Extremely Successful Price Strategy Could Burden AMD And Intel Investors Long Term,"The launch of the second Epyc CPU generation, powered by AMD's latest ZEN 2 core design, was not so long ago. At the moment, AMD is promoting the price/performance ratio of this Epyc generation. Given that, there is an extremely impressive defeat for Intel. Investors need to look at AMD's operations without bias and ask themselves whether management is really getting every possible USD of profit out of the company. In my opinion, AMD should put the focus a little more away from the penetration strategy, and instead, switch a little more to the skimming strategy."
4298895,2019-10-24,AMD's EPYC Blows Intel's Xeon Out Of The Water,"AMD has released EPYC Rome, its new line of server CPUs. It's apparent that Intel's current lineup of Xeon chips is overmatched. With advantages in price and performance, AMD is already gaining market share at Intel's expense."
4299120,2019-10-25,AMD Shares Look To Recover From Trade War Thaw,"Almost tripled in share values during the last two years, AMD may be the last stock you would call a victim of the trade war. Yet, AMD bulls would also tell you that the new 7nm products alone should have quadrupled the share price if it was not for the trade war. AMD’s margin was negatively affected by 1.3% because of the tariff cost. But the loss was more than offset by the higher margins of the new 7nm Ryzen and EYPC. After accounting for the improving financials, there is still a 22% discount currently applied to AMD’s value, which is related to trade war risk. If trade war thaws, AMD share will jump by $7."
4303899,2019-11-07,AMD On Track,"AMD has refreshed its portfolio with a richer product mix of CPUs and GPUs which set to challenge Intel and Nvidia heads on. The high-end server products allow AMD to increase its profit margin to 44-45% without giving up the low pricing advantage on the low-end products. For the first time of a long time, AMD finally has a decent chance to grab a meaningful share of GPU and CPU markets and deliver profitability simultaneously. AMD has to recognize the risk that Intel’s lineup of 14nm parts, 10nm, and an expansive portfolio of product adjacency will only regain some of the market share back. Considering both the growth and risk ahead, AMD shares look to hit mid to high $30s and stick by 2020 and low $40s in 1H 2021."
4304456,2019-11-08,AMD: Taking Patent Dynamics Into Account,"An analysis of AMD’s patent activity and patent dynamics. AMD’s patent scorecard, weekly and historical patent value, risk and disruptive scores in relation with stock price, market capitalization and competitors provide useful information to the investor. A look at AMD's in terms of technical analysis. Implications for AMD's stock price."
4310058,2019-12-02,Nvidia Vs. AMD: Not A Zero-Sum GPU Game,"Like Intel in the CPU space, Nvidia has started feeling AMD’s threat in the GPU space. Unlike Intel, Nvidia has been able to keep its dominance a little longer. The current analysts’ estimate suggests that Nvidia may lose at most 2-3% GPU market share to AMD in the next two years. Market share gain is more important to AMD than to Nvidia as AMD has a much smaller market share to start with. AMD shares are trading at a premium relative to Nvidia shares, reflecting AMD’s forthcoming GPU market share gain. Even with a projected 2.5% market share loss to AMD, both Nvidia and AMD shares will still gain as long as the entire AIB pie gains. There is no zero-sum game in the GPU market."
4310433,2019-12-04,Intel Vs. Advanced Micro Devices: Not A Zero-Sum CPU Game,"Since 2017, Intel has lost 10% PC CPU market share and 5% server market share to AMD. The current analysts’ estimate suggests that Intel may lose another 2% CPU market share to AMD in the next 2-3 years. Market share gain is more important to AMD than to Intel as AMD has a much smaller market share than Intel to start with. AMD’s shares are currently trading at a premium relative to Intel shares, reflecting AMD’s forthcoming CPU market share gain. Despite a projected 2% market share loss to AMD, Intel shares will still gain from the annual 5% growth of the CPU space."
4310967,2019-12-05,AMD Can Justify Its 'Forced To Be Perfect' Valuation,"Fundamental data suggest that AMD is now achieving a valuation that has more or less priced in perfect performance. Smaller obstacles or bad news can make the share price of a company run out of fresh steam quickly. However, I believe that some bear investors are overlooking the fact that AMD has the ability to make strategic price changes at any time. This would also change the valuation."
4314739,2019-12-31,A Realistic Valuation Of AMD Shares,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have gained 80% and 150% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. But AMD’s actual financials have not nearly arrived on the same order. The market has priced in a momentum factor which is from the expectation of AMD’s ability to gain meaningful CPU market shares in the near future. For a momentum stock, AMD investors tend to overweight future distant revenue, or future market share gains. At $46, AMD share is mildly overvalued by $3 after the momentum being considered. If the price premium is a result of positive sentiment,  AMD sentiment value tends to reverse itself in 2-3 weeks."
4315513,2020-01-06,My Top Tech Pick Of 2020 - AMD Has Beaten The S&P By 15x Since I First Recommended It,"AMD has performed incredibly well since I originally recommended it as My Top Tech Pick of 2018, returning 15x the S&P 500 average. The company has incredibly strong long-term potential, it has continued to gain server market share and dominates in the desktop CPU markets. The GPU markets are pending a big release in March 2020, and the company's financials have continued to improve significantly. I recommend AMD as my top tech pick of 2020. Let me know what you think in the comments below."
4315504,2020-01-06,AMD: Possible Three-Peat In 2020,"AMD topped the S&P 500 with a nearly 150% gain in 2019 after leading the index in 2018. Investors shouldn't bet on a three-peat performance, but the stock has the possibility for another strong year. My 2020 EPS estimate remains $10 billion revenues, $1.50 EPS plus a longer term $3+ EPS target."
4318430,2020-01-22,AMD: Fundamentals Trending Higher,"AMD shares are still on a tear, reaching $48.60 at the time of writing. The business is currently valued at $57 billion. I find this rally hard to believe. The way I see it, AMD shares are prone to a negative catalyst, meaning a negative catalyst could cause a huge downward adjustment in the stock. However, fundamentals trend higher. AMD's real opportunity is in the x86 CPU market. AMD is able to attack multiple growth vectors without much competition from Intel: notebook (Ryzen Mobile), desktop (Ryzen), and server (EPYC). As of writing, Nvidia is valued at $145 billion on exclusively GPU. Intel is valued at $260 billion on CPU and memory. AMD is valued at $57 billion while attacking both the CPU and GPU markets. Reiterating HOLD, PT raised from $28 to $44."
4320719,2020-01-31,AMD Stock Might Have Climbed Too Fast Despite Solid Performance In 2019,"AMD had a great run in 2019, as the company improved its financials and maintained stable profitability. The company has a great future with significant catalysts awaiting in 2020. However, the stock might have risen too fast for the market to digest. The valuation leaves little room for error."
4320713,2020-01-31,Advanced Micro Devices: Continuing To Revamp The Company,"Advanced Micro Devices is focused on continuing to revamp the company. The company has an impressive asset portfolio. The company is quickly becoming dominant in the CPU business, with market share growing rapidly and margins improving. I expect the company's profits will increase, pushing its P/E ratio down from 90 in 2019 to 15-16 by 2021-2022, assuming no share price increase. This cash could reward shareholders. I recommend investing in AMD for the long term."
4321070,2020-02-03,AMD's Perfect Situation Is Not Sustainable,"AMD is in a perfect situation, which is not sustainable. Intel is constrained by supply problems, has issues with their latest node, and has degraded performance because of security mitigations. NVIDIA is a node behind AMD, yet has the highest performing GPU."
4326757,2020-02-25,Alpha Trader Talks 'New Paradigm' Tech With Mark Hibben (Podcast),"This week's Alpha Trader features hosts Aaron Task and Stephen Alpher talking tech with Mark Hibben of Rethink Technology. Also up for discussion are the continuing coronavirus developments. A sizable economic slowdown now seems assured, and that's brought the potential for another round of rate cuts back into play. While the market averages may have brushed off much of the cornoavirus concern, Task notes about half the stocks in the Nasdaq are in bear markets - that is off 20% or more from 52-week highs. So take away the MAGA names and high-flyers like Tesla and Virgin Galactic, and it's already pretty ugly out there. Hibben isn't scared away by the gaudy one-year returns for a lot of the tech names he holds. He reminds that the big gains follow the major losses seen in the last few months of 2018. Still, Hibben acknowledges valuations are getting a little perky at these levels, and he's not finding a lot to buy right now. What Hibben calls new paradigm semiconductor companies (mostly Apple, but names like Samsung and Huawei also fit) are those that design most of the processors put into their products. At first derided as a Steve Jobs folly, Hibben argues that the shift has been perhaps the major reason for the massive profits at Apple over the last decade."
4331134,2020-03-11,AMD Highlights Path To The Future,"After a gangbuster performance on the stock market for the last several years, Advanced Micro Devices, its CEO Dr. Lisa Su, and its executive leadership team have been under the glare of a lot of media attention recently. Despite the apparent pressure, however, the company keeps coming out swinging and the announcements from last week's Financial Analyst Day indicate that AMD is showing no signs of letting up. All told, it was a very impressive set of announcements that highlights how AMD continues to build on the momentum it started to create a few years back."
4335058,2020-03-30,Advanced Micro Devices: Strong Performance During Downturn With Significant Potential,
4335495,2020-04-01,AMD: Advanced Bullish Sentiment,"AMD has comparatively performed well in times of high volatility. The performance already indicates a bullish sentiment among investors. Paradoxically, the relatively stable performance is counteracted by the high valuation. Given the high valuation, I would have expected a somewhat stronger correction. However, there are several factors that investors should be aware of and which support the bullish sentiment. Overall, there is an excellent risk/reward ratio for double-digit price gains because it is likely that AMD will reach its February highs as soon as the clouds disappear."
4338561,2020-04-20,AMD: Still Going Strong,AMD's CPU and GPU market share continues to grow. 7nm manufacturing process could further boost AMD in its competition against Intel. Possible catalysts: Release of PS5 and Xbox Series X and work from home shift.
4340427,2020-04-28,"Xilinx Still Has Growth Drivers, But The Street Has Gotten More Cautious","Xilinx's fiscal fourth quarter beat a lowered bar, with some more notable outperformance on the margin lines. Markets like auto, commercial aero, and general industrial are likely to be substantially weaker in Q2, and the wireless business has shrunk by more than half on increased ASIC substitution. The company has weathered big swings between bullishness and bearishness before, but management needs to rebuild confidence in long-term drivers like 5G wireless and data center. Shares aren't really """"cheap"""" yet, but they're trading at a much more reasonable valuation than they historically have, and they're worth watching as a sentiment reversal opportunity."
4347146,2020-05-13,Quo Vadis AMD: Too Good To Be A Bad Investment,"Currently, AMD has again reached a point where it was before the COVID-19 volatility. There is also the question of how to proceed with the share price gains. It is clear that there is no unlimited growth. The P/E ratio is also quite high. However, I think that marketing timing at AMD is the wrong way to go. Investors need to put the high P/E ratio into perspective. The excellent balance sheet and operating performance also underline that (further) share price increases are justified."
4349726,2020-05-23,"AMD: First Entering Intel's Turf, Now Nvidia's","AMD's newly announced GPU, the Radeon Pro VII, is equivalent to Nvidia's high-end GPUs, but at a fraction of the cost. The company's recent mobile CPU release, just a few days prior to the GPU release, helps solidify that lead. The company is improving both margins and its overall financial health, which will lead to increased shareholder returns and fiscal strength."
4350298,2020-05-27,AMD: 100X P/E Ratio Is Not Supported By 2020 Revenue Projections,No stock can maintain a 100x PE ratio without booming revenue. A recession/depression will depress overall demand. Competitor Intel is projecting a weak quarter 2. Competitive ARM processors are being used by Amazon and Microsoft.
4353585,2020-06-14,"AMD: Back Half Drivers, Stock Fair Value",AMD’s partnership with Nvidia shows the strength of its EPYC CPUs. Increased capacity at TSMC might indicate management expects strong demand. Next-generation gaming consoles will drive AMD’s growth in the second half of the year and next year. AMD is in a good position to capture a large part of the demand for data centers. Trade risks could weigh down the stock.
4355910,2020-06-26,AMD: Staying Invested Despite The Economy,"AMD is well-positioned in the face of economic headwinds. Expect consumer segment weakness in the latter half of the year. This will be partially offset by datacenter growth and next-gen console releases. The company is in market-capture mode; with best in class CPU offerings, there's a very large market opportunity to realistically grab away from Intel in most computing segments. At an NTM EV/S estimate of 6.9x, the risk-reward is attractive for an entry point."
4358455,2020-07-14,The AMD Superiority,"AMD is showing crazy good performance in its chip designs, finally gaining superiority of the once-dominant Intel. Apple's movement away from x86 chips in favor of producing is own ARM chips is actually beneficial to AMD, while detrimental to Intel. AMD is seeing the perfect storm of circumstances to solidify its dominance as the chip designer for performance."
4358295,2020-07-14,"AMD: Future Performance Is Already Priced In, Without Accounting For Risks","AMD's strong execution and recent turnaround deserve some premium valuation; however, price appreciation is running at extreme levels. Current share price is fully pricing in the next couple of years of expected sales growth and profitability improvements. At the same time, industry-specific risks of increased competition and disruption do not seem to matter much for AMD's share price."
4362103,2020-07-29,AMD: Not Worth It At $75,"I have been advocating a Buy rating on AMD for some time, and I see still see the fundamentals as extremely strong. My problem now is the valuation, which is stretched. While Intel continues to dangerously stumble especially on iterating on new nodes, AMD has begun to take advantage. AMD is seeing strong growth at all ends of the x86 market. Intel's stumbling and AMD's innovation combined have led to AMD becoming the performance leader in the x86 space. This means it will be able to address high-performance, high-margin segments. While the company continues to scale market share in PCs (desktop and notebook), the main catalysts for the stock will be consoles and server market share expansion. This seems priced in by now, however. Downgrading from Buy to Hold, PT set at $68."
4365080,2020-08-06,AMD: Crossing A Well-Deserved $100 Billion Valuation,AMD has an impressive portfolio of CPU and GPU assets and its recent quarter was a blowout. The company is well on the path to gaining market share from Intel and has performed incredibly well in the most recent quarter. The company has the ability to grow its EPS going forward which should result in significant shareholder rewards.
4367834,2020-08-11,Intel Tiger Lake Will Likely Crush AMD,"In a previous article, I suggested that Intel was likely to crush earnings. Intel delivered. Of course, since market share evolves slowly, this might not be fully representative of the current product competitive environment. In the past quarter, many have voiced that AMD currently has CPU leadership, a sentiment further ‘proved’ by Apple’s switch away from Intel silicon. However, Intel’s upcoming Tiger Lake will likely crush AMD in single-thread performance while being competitive in multi-thread, despite having half the number of cores. AMD’s purported ‘leadership’ is merely one of appearance: its products simply contain ‘more’ cores, not ‘better’ cores. AMD does not have a moat."
4372391,2020-09-03,Nvidia RTX Launch Suggests AMD May Have A Shot At High End Of GPU Market With Big Navi,"Nvidia launched one of the most compelling gaming lineups in recent history with Ampere RTX30x0 series. While the product is huge leap in performance compared to the previous generation, past disclosures from AMD suggest that it may be in the hunt for the high end with Big Navi. If AMD can pull off a high-end alternative, AMD investors could see a GPU battle with Nvidia, which is somewhat of a repeat of its recent CPU battle with Intel."
4375799,2020-09-22,AMD To Move More Of Its Business To TSMC,"Taiwan Economic Daily is indicating that AMD is increasingly moving its wafer fabrication business to TSMC. Why would AMD want to move more production to TSMC which is already production constrained? This article explains the rationale. AMD will start relying more and more on TSMC in the future for chips including CPUs, GPUs, and IO devices."
4375780,2020-09-23,AMD: New Highs Imminent,AMD's market share increased further in the first half of September. These gains should encourage OEMs and consumer-facing datacenter applications to adopt more Ryzen SKUs going forward. AMD's market share in other channels and markets is likely to increase as well.
4376813,2020-09-29,AMD To Strongly Benefit From New AI And Gaming Chips From Nvidia And AMD,"PCIe 4 is increasingly widely adopted by the PC and server industries. With Intel lacking critical PCIe 4 solutions, AMD is set to benefit. Nvidia's new AI and Gaming solutions are likely to drive considerable AMD CPU sales as described in the article."
4377287,2020-10-02,Why October Is AMD's Most Important Month Ever,"October is AMD's most important month ever. The company will announce its new CPUs and GPUs, including whether it maintains its mantle versus Intel and can compete with Nvidia. The company's financials have continued to perform incredibly well. Its FCF margin remains strong."
4379361,2020-10-16,AMD Zen 3: Still Benefiting Mostly From Intel Delays,"AMD has announced its latest Zen 3 CPUs. It delivers a larger-than-expected generational performance increase. However, despite a +19% IPC improvement, it barely overtakes Intel’s latest CPUs in single-threaded performance. AMD is benefiting immensely from Intel’s multi-year product delays, which continue to be visible. While AMD has taken the performance crown, it will likely lose this in 2021 to Intel."
4379881,2020-10-20,"AMD: Get Set, Go","AMD will be reporting its Q3 results on next Tuesday. The company is well-positioned for revenue outperformance. Readers and investors should closely watch its segment financials, shipment growth and listen in on management's outlook."
4384407,2020-11-03,AMD: Radeon RX 6000 On TSMC 7nm Can Address Unmet High-End GPU Demand,"AMD Q3 2020 report shows clear year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter gains across product portfolio. I expect 20-30% Y/Y Q4 2020 revenue growth driven by GPU sales. AMD's newest RX 6000 GPUs were revealed to match NVIDIA's RTX 3000 cards in performance and will launch when current market demand far outstrips supply. Going into 2021, AMD's expanded access to TSMC's 7nm node will allow greater manufacturing capacity for high-end consumer GPUs, giving the opportunity to compete with NVIDIA on performance and price."
4387247,2020-11-09,AMD's Most Important Month In Review,"At the start of October, we said that the month would be AMD's most important month ever.

AMD's valuation at 18x, 2026 earnings suggests room for growth, with a potential rally if it clears the $115 resistance. The main risk remains the China trade war, but AI-driven growth could make AMD a top performer in 2025. Strong Buy rating."
4785545,2025-05-12,AMD: Strong Upside Potential If U.S.-China Trade Talks Turn Constructive,"AMD's 1Q FY2025 revenue topped the high end of its previous guidance, with strong margin expansion resulting in 55% YoY growth in non-GAAP EPS. The weak 2Q FY2025 outlook is largely impacted by the inventory write-off due to the MI308 chip ban in China. FY2025 remains a YoY growth rebound year, even considering the $1.5 billion revenue headwind from China, with Gaming and Embedded contributing positive YoY growth. AI data center demand remains strong, with AMD gaining CPU market share and beginning production of its fifth-gen EPYC at TSMC's new Arizona fab in April. The stock's valuation is attractive at 25x non-GAAP P/E fwd, nearly 50% cheaper than in my last analysis, supporting a Strong Buy as recent constructive trade talks could lift sentiment."
4787693,2025-05-16,"AMD's AI Strategy Sprints Past Intel, Firmly In The Fast Lane","AMD's Q1 2025 earnings exceeded forecasts with a 36% revenue increase, driven by AI demand and upcoming """"Advancing AI 2025"""" event. AMD's GPUs, particularly the MI300X and the upcoming MI350 Series, lead in AI inference performance, challenging Nvidia's dominance. AMD's forward P/E ratio of 24.45 and PEG ratio under 1 indicate undervaluation, with earnings expected to grow 31.26%-45% annually. Despite strong growth prospects, AMD faces significant competition from Nvidia and Intel, and risks from supply chain disruptions and export restrictions."
4788744,2025-05-21,AMD's Runner-Up Position Remains A Viable Rebound Story,"AMD remains a viable rebound investing story, thanks to its overly discounted valuations, robust Free Cash Flow generation, and healthy balance sheet.
         This is on top of its growing x86 market share, with it already accretive to its client/ data center CPU sales at double digits YoY growth.
         We are likely to see improved data center sales growth profile from H2'25 onwards as well, thanks to the launch of its Instinct data center GPUs ahead.
         This is on top of AMD's accretive acquisition, ZT Systems, allowing them to offer the integrated/ customized GPU rack and cluster-scale AI systems to hyperscalers/ cloud providers.
         While there remains growth risks to its investment thesis, we believe that its discounted valuations and the $78s trading floor support its rich rebound investing story."

AMD's AI opportunities are expanding, highlighted by a $10B Saudi joint venture and growing demand from sovereign nations for AI infrastructure. The company continues to gain CPU market share from Intel, and the ZT Systems acquisition strengthens its data center competitiveness against Nvidia. While risks remain from Intel's potential turnaround and cyclical volatility, AMD's growth prospects and current entry point make it a compelling investment."
